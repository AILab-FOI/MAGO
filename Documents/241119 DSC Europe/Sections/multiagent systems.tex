    \blockquote[{{\cite[p. 54]{russell2022ArtificialIntelligenceModern}}}]{An agent is \alert<2->{anything} that can be viewed as \alert<2->{perceiving} its environment through sensors and \alert<2->{acting} upon that environment through actuators.}

    \blockquote[{{\cite{wooldridge2013IntelligentAgents}}}]{An agent is a computer system that is situated in some environment, and that is capable of \alert{autonomous} action in this environment in order to achieve its delegated objectives.}

    A \ac{MAS} is a system wherein \blockquote[\cite{russell2022ArtificialIntelligenceModern}]{\textelp{} an agent must make decisions in environments that contain multiple actors.}

    \onslide<+->
    \bigskip
    In more detail, a \ac{MAS} is a system wherein \cite{dignum2013MultiagentOrganizations}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item each agent has incomplete information or capabilities for solving the problem and, thus, has a \alert{limited viewpoint}; 
        \item there is no system global \alert{control}; 
        \item data are \alert{decentralized};
        \item computation is \alert{asynchronous}.
    \end{itemize}

    Agents can be cooperative or competitive. Often modelled as organisations.
