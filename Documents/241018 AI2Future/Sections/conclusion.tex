\section{Conclusion}

\begin{frame}{\insertsection}
    The framework, in its presented state, is a \alert{work-in-progress} package.

    Further improvements are seen in:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item rendering strategy-related concepts using languages that allow for reasoning;
        \item implementing the framework as a distributed system that would focus on deploying agent implementation templates over several workspaces;
        \item further testing the framework using different scenarios;
        \item adapting the implementation templates to different agent development frameworks.
    \end{itemize}
