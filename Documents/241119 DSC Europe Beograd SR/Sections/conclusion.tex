\section{Conclusion}

\begin{frame}{\insertsection}
    In its presented state, the framework is a \alert{work-in-progress} package.

    Further improvements are seen in:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item rendering strategy-related concepts using languages that allow for reasoning;
        \item implementing the framework as a distributed system that would focus on deploying agent implementation templates over several workspaces;
        \item use the \magoag ontology to facilitate sending agent information and whole agents;
        \item further testing the framework using different scenarios;
        \item adapting the implementation templates to different agent development frameworks;
        \item using the \magoag ontology in combination with a language model.
    \end{itemize}
