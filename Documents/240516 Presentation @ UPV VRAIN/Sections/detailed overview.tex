    \begin{exampleblock}{Part \RN{1}-A}
        Modelling an \alert{ontology} featuring organisational concepts, towards implementing a framework for \alert{instantiating agents} based on the contents of the ontology \alert{and running \iac{MAS}} based on a knowledge base.
    \end{exampleblock}

    \onslide<+->
    \begin{exampleblock}{Part \RN{1}-B}
        Designing, developing and implementing the \alert{framework for instantiating} and running \iac{MAS} described using an ontology. Implementing a \alert{testbed environment} for applying, testing and evaluating the developed ontology.
