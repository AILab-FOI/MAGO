  abstract = {Several successful initiatives have resulted from the OER movement. One of them is Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) which is a popular learning mode as it offers an affordable and flexible way to learn. However, the evolution of the MOOCs has some challenges. One of the major problems of MOOCs is the diversity of learners and the need to personalize the content as well as the way of delivering it. The origin of this problem is the one size does not fit all. In fact, learners have different characteristics such as their learning styles, levels of knowledge, and so on. The selection of the most suitable parameters (set of complementary learners' characteristics) to be considered in learner's profile is not easy in the presence of a considerable number of learners in MOOCs. One reason is because a course can be attended by many learners with varied profiles from different regions of the world. This plurality of learner profiles makes it important to develop content that can meet the needs and objectives of each learner in MOOCS. Our solution to solve this problem consists of personalizing the content of MOOC for each learner. We propose a new approach which allows to optimize the selection of the personalization parameters and to apply the appropriate personalization strategy, based on a classification algorithm. The proposed approach aims to improve the retention rate and the quality of learning in MOOCs. This approach is validated by experiments which test its success when applied to many combinations of strategies and learner profiles.},

  abstract = {The increased complexity and dynamism of present and future Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) enforce the need for considering both of their static (design-time) and the dynamic (run-time) aspects. A type of balance between the two aspects can definitely give better results related to system stability and adaptivity. MAS organization is the research area that is concerned with these issues and it is currently a very active and interesting research area. Designing a MAS with an initial organization and giving it the ability to dynamically reorganize to adapt the dynamic changes of its unpredictable and uncertain environment, is the feasible way to survive and to run effectively. Normally, MAS organization is tackled by what is called, MAS organizational models, which are concerned with the description (formally or informally) of the structural and dynamical aspects of agent organizations. This paper proposes a two-dimension space, called MOS-2, for positioning and assessing MAS organizational models based on two dimensions: their adopted engineering viewpoint (agent-centered or organization-centered) as the vertical dimension and the agents awareness/unawareness of the existence of the organizational level as the horizontal dimension. The MOS-2 space is applied for positioning a number of familiar organizational models. Its future trends and possible improvements are highlighted. They include the following, (1) adding Time as a dimension, (2) increasing the considered dimensions, (3) providing a quantitative approach for positioning MAS organizational models.},

The proposed approach adopts the emerging agent technology, which has proven to be the most representative among artificial systems dealing with complexity and high distribution. Agent-based systems that have the ability to dynamically reorganise themselves will be adaptive enough to survive within their unpredictable and highly changing environments. Adaptive agent-based systems are designed to be capable to adapt themselves to unforeseen situations in an autonomous manner. Engineering modern complex, highly distributed, and large-scale SCADA systems is currently a challenging issue and agents and multi-agent systems (MAS) can provide a feasible solution to this problem. In this paper, a self-adaptive large-scale SCADA system is designed and implemented based on dynamically organised adaptive MAS. A prototype was developed and evaluated within a simulation environment for demonstrating the effect of the transparently realised dynamic reorganisation on the system-to-be performance.},

  abstract = {Gamification---the use of game elements in serious contexts, has been prevalent to enhance users' motivation and engagement in difficult activities. In the literature related to higher education, the use of gamification has emerged as a new pedagogical approach in order to improve students' learning behaviors. On the other hand, traditional education research suggested that working in groups can enhance students' learning behaviors. However, no study has been found in the literature that investigates these two distinct concepts in education domain. Therefore, this research aims to explore the effect of different group sizes and gamification on students' learning behaviors. For this purpose, the study has explored the comparison between gamification and traditional classroom settings on students' learning behavior with different group sizes: individual, small group, and large group settings. Further, the comparison of students' learning behaviors in gamification environment within different group settings over time has also been investigated in this research. The analysis suggests that different group sizes can have varying impacts on students' perception of the course in gamification environment over time. Moreover, it was observed that group size only affects students' interest, comparison, and discouragement in gamification environment, but does not affect their effort, perceived choice, perceived competence, tension, or motivation. Also, it was found that gamification does not affect the perceived competence of students in any of the group settings. These results can be useful in future decisions about the optimal classroom size, group activities, and group sizes in other activities in larger classrooms.},

  abstract = {We study a particular multiagent resource allocation problem with indivisible, but sharable resources. In our model, the utility of an agent for using a bundle of resources is the difference between the value the agent would assign to that bundle in isolation and a congestion cost that depends on the number of agents she has to share each of the resources in her bundle with.The valuation function determining the value and the delay function deter- mining the congestion cost can be agent-dependent. When the agents that share a resource also share control over that resource, then the current users of a resource will require some compensation when a new agent wants to join them using the resource. For this scenario of shared control, we study the existence of distributed negotiation protocols that lead to a social optimum. Depending on constraints on the valuation functions (mainly modularity), on the delay functions (such as convexity), and on the structural complexity of the deals between agents, we prove either the existence of a sequences of deals leading to a social optimum or the convergence of all sequences of deals to such an optimum.We also analyse the length of the path leading to such optimal allocations. For scenarios where the agents using a resource do not have shared control over that resource (i.e., where any agent can use any resource she wants), we study the existence of pure Nash equilibria, i.e., allocations in which no single agent has an incentive to add or drop any of the resources she is currently holding.We pro- vide results for modular valuation functions, we analyse the length of the paths leading to a pureNash equilibrium, and we relate our findings to results from the literature on congestion games.},

  abstract = {For the development of Semantic Web the the World Wide Web Consortium has focussed on the future Web Ontology Language standard OWL 2 and rule languages in Rule Interchange Format which are required to interoperate. A lot of researches have been carried out towards the integration of various Description Logics and rules and RIF-OWL combination is a step forward in this direction. Most of the Description logics are a decidable subset of classical First-Order logic while rules originate from logic programming. In this thesis, we discuss the combination of Description Logics and negation-free rules, both of which are expressed in the standard FirstOrder logic semantics. We propose an algorithm for reasoning which is sound but not complete for these combinations. Our algorithm uses existing standard reasoning tool for retrieving facts from the Description Logic Knowledge Base with which rules are put together to form a logic program. Finally, rule reasoner is used for answering conjunctive queries on this logic program. We identify the reasons behind the incompleteness and chose a subset of these combinations which combines restricted Description Logic and rules. This restricted subset consists of Description Logic Horn-SHIQ and rules such that Description Logic predicates are allowed only in the rule bodies and all the rules are DL-safe. A prototype implementation of the reasoning process is also presented which uses Pellet Description Logic reasoner and XSB rule reasoner showing the effectiveness of using existing tools with our algorithm. The combination chosen in this thesis can express strictly more information in the Description Logic component compared to the combination of DLP extended using rules.},

  abstract = {Purpose E-learning has gained much focus from educators and researchers, with many extolling e-learning over traditional learning. Despite this focus, implementation of e-learning systems often fails. Literature considers a range of barriers, impacting the success of e-learning implementations, yet to the best of our knowledge no conceptual framework is able to consolidate existing research. Design/methodology/approach This paper undertook an in-depth review of literature concerning e-learning implementation barriers. Papers were extracted from established peer-reviewed journals and open sources. Articles not related to e-learning implementation barriers were discarded. A total of 259 papers were identified, published between 1990 and 2016. Hermeneutics and data-driven qualitative content analysis was used to define 68 unique barriers. Findings The 68 unique barriers were thematically grouped into four conceptual categories, i.e. Technology (T), Individual (I), Pedagogy (P) and Enabling Conditions (EC). These 4 categories led to the conceptualization of ?TIPEC? Framework, which highlights the key concepts hindering e-learning implementation and delivery. Results show that most articles only consider a narrow range of success barriers. Practical implications The proposed TIPEC framework acts as a guide for education practitioners, system developers, policy makers and researchers. It provides stakeholders with a summary of e-learning barriers. Originality/value This paper fulfils an identified need for a conceptual framework that consolidates all current research related to E-learning implementation barriers.},

  abstract = {Education 4.0 is a new educational paradigm that intends to address the needs and potentialities of the fourth industrial revolution. Education 4.0 builds on the concept of learning by doing, in which students are encouraged to learn and discover different things in singular ways based on experimentation. This study intends to analyze the role of emerging technologies like serious games and industry 4.0 in the transformation of education 4.0 in higher education. A qualitative methodology was employed based on 25 case studies of innovative projects in Portuguese higher education institutions. The results indicate a residual adoption of serious games and gamification approaches only appear in less than 20\% of the projects. It was also possible to identify that most projects involve several stakeholders such as teachers, students and university managers, and typically involve multidisciplinary competencies fields. The main benefits brought to the education context include greater involvement of students in projects, development of their skills and its application in a real context. On the other hand, the main challenges are the simplification of the real world made by these applications, the difficulties inherent to their inclusion in the didactical system and the limited capacities to offer greater interactivity without predefined external stimuli.},

  abstract = {Context: While most research shows positive effects of gamification, the focus on its adverse effects is considerably smaller and further understanding of these effects is needed. Objective: To provide a comprehensive overview on research reporting negative effects of game design elements and to provide insights into the awareness of developers on these effects and into how they could be considered in practice. Method: We conducted a systematic mapping study of the negative effects of game design elements on education/learning systems. We also held a focus group discussion with developers of a gamified software, discussing the mapping study results with regard to their awareness and perceptions on the reported negative effects in practice. Results: The mapping study revealed 87 papers reporting undesired effects of game design elements. We found that badges, leaderboards, competitions, and points are the game design elements most often reported as causing negative effects. The most cited negative effects were lack of effect, worsened performance, motivational issues, lack of understanding, and irrelevance. The ethical issues of gaming the system and cheating were also often reported. As part of our results, we map the relations between game design elements and the negative effects that they may cause. The focus group revealed that developers were not aware of many of the possible negative effects and that they consider this type of information useful. The discussion revealed their agreement on some of those potential negative effects and also some positive counterparts. Conclusions: Gamification, when properly applied, can have positive effects on education/learning software. However, gamified software is also prone to generate harmful effects. Revealing and discussing potentially negative effects can help to make more informed decisions considering their trade-off with respect to the expected benefits.},

The example that has rudely struck humanity is the Covid-19 pandemic, a disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Although the history of humanity accounts for multiple pandemics caused by various infectious agents, it is true that uncertainty prevails when faced with a global problem of this nature. Before it, there is a moral obligation to provide the best possible health services; at the same time, research should be carried out to find specific pharmaceutical measures that contain and mitigate the damage to the population (specific drugs and/or vaccines). Meanwhile, knowing that in the case of the current Covid-19 pandemic the main and most efficient route of transmission is the spread by droplets of saliva, physical distancing is crucial. A medical consultation involves speaking during the questioning and physical proximity during the examination. There is data that indicates that telemedicine has a high degree of recommendation for the protection of the health of both professionals and patients. It is recalled that a statement from the World Medical Association has addressed the issue of telemedicine; with its presentation, scope, limitations and future projections are indicated.},

  abstract = {Dementia refers to a group of chronic conditions that cause the permanent and gradual cognitive decline. Therefore, a Person with Dementia (PwD) requires constant care from various classes of caregivers. The care costs of PwDs bear a tremendous burden on healthcare systems around the world. It is commonly accepted that utilising smart homes (SH), as an instance of ambient assisted living (AAL) technologies, can facilitate the care, and consequently improve the quality of PwDs wellbeing. Nevertheless, most of the existing platforms assume dementia care is a straight application of standard SH technology without accommodating the specific requirements of dementia care. A consequence of this approach is the inadequacy and unacceptability of generic SH systems in the context of dementia care. Contrary to most of the existing SH systems proposed for dementia care, this study considers the specific requirements of PwDs and their care circle in all development steps of an SH. In addition, it investigates how utilising novel design and computing approaches can enhance the quality of SHs for dementia care. To do so, the requirements of dementia care stakeholders are collected, analysed and reflected on in an SH system design. Extensions and adaptation of existing frameworks and technologies are proposed to implement a prototype based on the resulting design. Finally, thorough evaluations and validation of the prototype are carried out. The evaluations by a group of stakeholders show the suitability of the proposed methodology and consequently the resulting prototypes for reducing dementia care difficulties as well as its potential for deployment in the real-world environment.},

In this paper, we consider the problem of procedurally generating a quest, defined as a series of actions required to progress towards a goal, in a text-adventure game. Quest generation in text environments is challenging because they must be semantically coherent. We present and evaluate two quest generation techniques: (1) a Markov chains, and (2) a neural generative model. We specifically look at generating quests about cooking and train our models on recipe data. We evaluate our techniques with human participant studies looking at perceived creativity and coherence.},

  abstract = {Interactive fictions---also called text-based games---are games in which a player interacts with a virtual world purely through textual natural language. In this work, we focus on procedurally generating interactive fiction worlds. Generating these worlds requires (a) referencing everyday and thematic commonsense priors in addition to (b) being semantically consistent, (c) interesting, (d) coherent throughout, all while (e) producing fluent natural language descriptions of places, people, and things. Using existing story plots from books as inspiration, we present a method that first extracts a partial knowledge graph encoding basic information regarding world structure such as locations and objects. This knowledge graph is then automatically completed utilizing thematic knowledge and used to guide a neural language generation model that fleshes out the rest of the world. We evaluate generated worlds with human-participant studies, comparing our technique against rule-based and human-made baselines1.},

  abstract = {Interactive Fiction games are text-based simulations in which an agent interacts with the world purely through natural language. They are ideal environments for studying how to extend reinforcement learning agents to meet the challenges of natural language understanding, partial observability, and action generation in combinatorially-large text-based action spaces. We present KG-A2C, an agent that builds a dynamic knowledge graph while exploring and generates actions using a template-based action space. We contend that the dual uses of the knowledge graph to reason about game state and to constrain natural language generation are the keys to scalable exploration of combinatorially large natural language actions. Results across a wide variety of IF games show that KG-A2C outperforms current IF agents despite the exponential increase in action space size.},

  abstract = {Agent-based models (ABMs) are quite new in the modeling landscape; they emerged on the scene in the 1990s. ABMs have a clear advantage over other approaches: they create the capacity to manage learning processes in agents and discover novelties in their behavior. In addition to bounded rationality assumptions, ABMs share a number of peculiar characteristics: first of all, a bottom-up perspective is assumed where the properties of macro-dynamics are emergent properties of micro-dynamics involving individuals as heterogeneous agents who live in complex systems that evolve through time. To apply this framework to financial crisis analysis, a simplified implementation of the SWARM protocol (www.swarm.org), based on Python, is introduced. The result is the Swarm-Like Agent Protocol in Python (SLAPP). Using SLAPP, it is possible to focus on natural phenomena and social behavior. In the case of this chapter, the authors focus on the banking system, recreating the interactions of a community of financial institutions that act in the payment system and in the interbank market for short-term liquidity.},

The aim of this work has been to analyze the effects of emotion management on time and self-management in e-learning and identify the competencies in time and self-management that are mostly influenced when students strive to achieve effective learning. To this end, we run an experiment with a class of high school students, which showed that increasing their ability to manage emotions better and more effectively enhances their competency to manage the time allocated to the learning practice more productively, and consequently their. learning performance in terms of behavioral engagement and achievement and partly, in terms of cognitive engagement and self-regulation. Teacher affective feedback was proved to be a crucial factor to enhance cognitive engagement. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Background and Aim.Gamification is growing in popularity in education and workplace training, but it is unclear which game elements are conducive to learning. The theory of gamified learning suggests that one type of gamification, the addition of game fiction/narrative, can be used to improve learning outcomes, and the Technology-Enhanced Training Effectiveness Model (TETEM) suggests individual differences impact the strength of this effect. From this theoretical basis, this study gamified a training module with game fiction in order to improve outcomes over the original training.             Results and Conclusion. In a study of 273 learners, trainees were significantly more satisfied with training enhanced with game fiction over the control text ( d = 0.65) but did not differ in declarative knowledge scores by condition. Further, trainees in the control condition scored higher on procedural knowledge than trainees in the game fiction condition, although the effect was smaller ( d = -0.40). Thus, the use of narrative improved reactions to training but at some cost to training effectiveness. Attitudes toward game-based learning were also tested as a moderator of the condition-outcome relationship.},

This scoping review aimed to assess the evidence regarding the value of gamification as part of health science undergraduate education, in comparison to conventional teaching curriculum. A comprehensive systematic literature search was conducted in MEDLINE, EMC are and Cochrane databases. Articles were eligible if they were randomised controlled trials comparing the use of gamification for undergraduate health profession students, with conventional teaching methods. Outcomes included knowledge (ie., information acquisition), skills (ie., knowledge application) and perceived benefit. Screening, data extraction and critical appraisal was conducted by two reviewers independently. Eleven RCT studies were included (n = 997). Three of eight reporting studies discovered significant findings for knowledge acquisition scores favouring the intervention group. Varying results were demonstrated in the skills domain across six studies. Perceived benefits including student motivation and satisfaction levels demonstrated positive findings in all but one of six reporting studies. Educators should supplement methods with gamified learning rather than replace them, consider group-based gamification, and employ methods at irregular intervals. The findings of this review suggest that gamification may be advantageous for health science undergraduates. Gamification positively impacts student satisfaction and motivation, though its capacity to enhance students' knowledge acquisition and application necessitates further research. (English)},

The construction of these models must adhere to a permitted structure that itself can be specified as a model - a meta-model. Nowadays, meta-modeling plays a growing role in Information Systems Engineering and is becoming a universal technique to define generic information structures, reference models, and modeling languages. However, for researchers and practitioners engaged in a meta-modeling activity, certain conceptual and operational issues remain vague and the full potential of meta-models not thoroughly understood. The goal of this tutorial is to give attendees a clear picture of the latest research in meta-modeling, to illustrate the variety of application domains and to demonstrate possibilities offered by available meta-CASE technologies along with their limits. Attendees will acquire the knowledge needed to properly envision the role of meta-models in information systems life-cycle and, accordingly, to select the adequate meta-modeling technical infrastructure.},

  abstract = {Current instructional methods widely support verbal learning through linear and sequential teaching materials, focusing on isolated pieces of information. However, an important aspect of learning design is to facilitate students in identifying relationships between information. The transformation of linearity in teaching resources into integrated network models such as concept maps facilitates effective knowledge organisation by constructing relationships between new and existing knowledge. However, the manual construction of concept maps from teaching materials places an additional workload on the academics involved. Consequently, this research investigates the effectiveness of automated approaches in extracting concept maps from lecture slides and the suitability of auto-generated concept maps as a pedagogical tool. We develop a set of Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms to support concept-relation-concept triple extraction to form concept maps. Structural and graph-based features are utilised to rank the triples according to their importance. The natural layout of the lecture slides is incorporated to organise the triples in a hierarchy, facilitating highly integrated structure. Our evaluation studies identify promising results, with several case studies demonstrating a statistically significant correlation (rs {$>$} 0.455) between auto-generated concept maps and human experts' judgment. Auto-generated concept maps were rated from `good' to `very good' by the academics on evaluation factors such as coverage, accuracy, and suitability as a pedagogical tool. Thus, auto-generated concept maps from this research can be utilised as a positive alternative to the manual construction of expert concept maps and further, it is possible to utilise these maps for a wider range of applications including knowledge organisation and reflective visualisation of course contents. Our research contributes to bridging the gap between linearity in teaching materials and the necessity of creating integrated network models from teaching resources.},

  abstract = {In recent years, online social networking has revolutionized interpersonal communication. The newer research on language analysis in social media has been increasingly focusing on the latter's impact on our daily lives, both on a personal and a professional level. Natural language processing (NLP) is one of the most promising avenues for social media data processing. It is a scientific challenge to develop powerful methods and algorithms which extract relevant information from a large volume of data coming from multiple sources and languages in various formats or in free form. We discuss the challenges in analyzing social media texts in contrast with traditional documents. Research methods in information extraction, automatic categorization and clustering, automatic summarization and indexing, and statistical machine translation need to be adapted to a new kind of data. This book reviews the current research on NLP tools and methods for processing the non-traditional information from social media data that is available in large amounts (big data), and shows how innovative NLP approaches can integrate appropriate linguistic information in various fields such as social media monitoring, healthcare, business intelligence, industry, marketing, and security and defence. We review the existing evaluation metrics for NLP and social media applications, and the new efforts in evaluation campaigns or shared tasks on new datasets collected from social media. Such tasks are organized by the Association for Computational Linguistics (such as SemEval tasks) or by the National Institute of Standards and Technology via the Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) and the Text Analysis Conference (TAC). In the concluding chapter, we discuss the importance of this dynamic discipline and its great potential for NLP in the coming decade, in the context of changes in mobile technology, cloud computing, virtual reality, and social networking. In this second edition, we have added information about recent progress in the tasks and applications presented in the first edition. We discuss new methods and their results. The number of research projects and publications that use social media data is constantly increasing due to continuously growing amounts of social media data and the need to automatically process them. We have added 85 new references to the more than 300 references from the first edition. Besides updating each section, we have added a new application (digital marketing) to the section on media monitoring and we have augmented the section on healthcare applications with an extended discussion of recent research on detecting signs of mental illness from social media.},

The novel approach taken here banishes determinants to the end of the book. The text focuses on the central goal of linear algebra: understanding the structure of linear operators on finite-dimensional vector spaces. The author has taken unusual care to motivate concepts and to simplify proofs. A variety of interesting exercises in each chapter helps students understand and manipulate the objects of linear algebra. The third edition contains major improvements and revisions throughout the book. More than 300 new exercises have been added since the previous edition. Many new examples have been added to illustrate the key ideas of linear algebra. New topics covered in the book include product spaces, quotient spaces, and dual spaces. Beautiful new formatting creates pages with an unusually pleasant appearance in both print and electronic versions. No prerequisites are assumed other than the usual demand for suitable mathematical maturity. Thus the text starts by discussing vector spaces, linear independence, span, basis, and dimension. The book then deals with linear maps, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors. Inner-product spaces are introduced, leading to the finite-dimensional spectral theorem and its consequences. Generalized eigenvectors are then used to provide insight into the structure of a linear operator.},

  abstract = {A negotiation between agents is typically an incomplete information game, where the agents initially do not know their opponent's preferences or strategy. This poses a challenge, as efficient and effective negotiation requires the bidding agent to take the other's wishes and future behavior into account when deciding on a proposal. Therefore, in order to reach better and earlier agreements, an agent can apply learning techniques to construct a model of the opponent. There is a mature body of research in negotiation that focuses on modeling the opponent, but there exists no recent survey of commonly used opponent modeling techniques. This work aims to advance and integrate knowledge of the field by providing a comprehensive survey of currently existing opponent models in a bilateral negotiation setting. We discuss all possible ways opponent modeling has been used to benefit agents so far, and we introduce a taxonomy of currently existing opponent models based on their underlying learning techniques. We also present techniques to measure the success of opponent models and provide guidelines for deciding on the appropriate performance measures for every opponent model type in our taxonomy.},

The process and outcomes of such interventions entirely depend on the stakeholder's level of engagement and willingness to contribute to the discussion. Gamification, in its turn, has been extensively used to increase engagement in an activity and nudge certain behaviors. Several gamification frameworks exist for stakeholder engagement; however, none fully considers the context of the modeling workshops with stakeholders.},

  abstract = {In the last fifteen years especially, a paradigmatic shift has been observed in game studies, a paradigm in which games are consistently conceptualised as spatial objects. This calls for methodological reflections, one of which is this article's focus: the ontology of game spatiality. Scholars frequently depend on metaphorical concepts -- for example, ``labyrinths,'' ``gardens'' or ``virtual cities'' -- to describe something as intricate as game space, the ontological levels of which they frequently mistake. This article seeks to remedy these tendencies through a formal framework, achieved by taking a step back from particulars and approaching games from the general perspective of ontology. More specifically, it takes the cybermedia model as a point of departure in order to formalise a four-layered framework of spatiality comprising the representational, the mechanical, the material and the player level. This ontology allows for analysis and comparison of vastly different game systems, even those upheld entirely by the players themselves, such as physical sports like association football.},

The advent of blockchain has generated great interest as an alternative to centralized organizations, where the data is gathered through a centralized ledger keeping of activities of the firm. The decentralized ledger keeping is one of the main features of blockchain that has given rise to many issues of technology, development, implementation, privacy, acceptance, evaluation and so on. Blockchain concept is a follow-up to big data environment facilitated by enormous progress in computer hardware, storage capacities and technological prowess. This has resulted in the rapid acquiring of data not considered possible earlier. With shrewd modeling analytics and algorithms, the applications have grown to significant levels. This handbook discusses the progress in data collection, pros and cons of collecting information on decentralized publicly available ledgers and several applications"--},

  abstract = {Large-scale diffusion-based generative models have led to breakthroughs in text-conditioned high-resolution image synthesis. Starting from random noise, such text-to-image diffusion models gradually synthesize images in an iterative fashion while conditioning on text prompts. We find that their synthesis behavior qualitatively changes throughout this process: Early in sampling, generation strongly relies on the text prompt to generate text-aligned content, while later, the text conditioning is almost entirely ignored. This suggests that sharing model parameters throughout the entire generation process may not be ideal. Therefore, in contrast to existing works, we propose to train an ensemble of text-to-image diffusion models specialized for different synthesis stages. To maintain training efficiency, we initially train a single model, which is then split into specialized models that are trained for the specific stages of the iterative generation process. Our ensemble of diffusion models, called eDiffi, results in improved text alignment while maintaining the same inference computation cost and preserving high visual quality, outperforming previous large-scale text-to-image diffusion models on the standard benchmark. In addition, we train our model to exploit a variety of embeddings for conditioning, including the T5 text, CLIP text, and CLIP image embeddings. We show that these different embeddings lead to different behaviors. Notably, the CLIP image embedding allows an intuitive way of transferring the style of a reference image to the target text-to-image output. Lastly, we show a technique that enables eDiffi's "paint-with-words" capability. A user can select the word in the input text and paint it in a canvas to control the output, which is very handy for crafting the desired image in mind.

Task specificity should go hand in hand with domain orientation, that is, the specialization of an LLM to accurately address the tasks of a given realm of interest. However, models are usually fine-tuned over publicly available data or, at most, over ground data from databases, ignoring business-level definitions and domain experience. On the other hand, Enterprise Knowledge Graphs (EKGs) are able to capture and augment such domain knowledge via ontological reasoning. With the goal of combining LLM flexibility with the domain orientation of EKGs, we propose a novel neurosymbolic architecture that leverages the power of ontological reasoning to build task- and domain-specific corpora for LLM fine-tuning.},

As expected, increased game violence elicited greater CV reactivity and higher scores on hostility measures. Subjects who played MK1 or MK2 had higher heart rate reactivity than those who played billiards. Subjects who played MK2 showed greater systolic blood pressure reactivity than those who played MK1 or billiards. Finally, subjects who played MK2 scored higher on the hostility measures than those who played MK1, who in turn scored higher than those who played billiards.

And, what are knowledge and wisdom? Are there such things as knowledge quality and wisdom quality? As these primitives are the most basic axioms of information systems research, it is somewhat surprising that consensus on exact definitions seems to be lacking. This paper presents a theoretical and empirical exploration of the sometimes directly quoted, and often implied Data, Information, Knowledge, Wisdom (DIKW) hierarchy and its quality dimension. We first review relevant literature from a range of perspectives and develop and contextualise a theoretical DIKW framework through semiotics. The literature review identifies definitional commonalities and divergences from a scholarly perspective; the theoretical discussion contextualises the terms and their relationships within a semiotic framework and proposes relevant definitions grounded in that framework. Next, rooted in Wittgenstein's ordinary language philosophy, we analyse 20 online news articles for their uses of the terms and present the results of an online focus group discussion comprising 16 information systems experts.

  abstract = {In this paper we study the problem of forming coalitions for dynamic tasks in multirobot systems. As robots, either individually or in groups, encounter new tasks for which individual or group resources do not suffice, robot coalitions that are collectively capable of meeting these requirements need to be formed. We propose a hybrid approach to this problem where coalitions proceed with the task if they have sufficient resources after liberating redundant members while they report it to a task coordinator in cases where their resources do not suffice. In turn, the task coordinator forms capable coalitions based on coalition formation games in which groups of robots are evaluated together in regards to each task's required resources and cost of forming a coalition. The resulting coalitions are such that no group of robots has a viable alternative to staying within their assigned coalition. Thus, as new tasks are confronted, coalitions merge and split so that the resulting coalitions are capable of the newly encountered tasks. Simulations and experiments performed on groups of heterogeneous mobile robots demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

The idea is to develop a realistic virtual environment to test particular domain-specific procedures. This paper presents our general framework for interactive multiagent-based simulations in virtual environments. The major contribution of this paper is the integration of the notion of ontology as a core element to the design process of a behavioral simulation. The proposed metamodel describes the concepts of a multiagent simulation using situated agents moving in a semantically enriched 3D environment. The agents perceive the geometric and semantic data in the surrounding environment. They are also able to act in this environment by using high-level actions, which are described by the ontology of the environment. The concepts relating to the environment, the agent, and the entire simulation models are presented. Additionally, guidelines are given to exploit the simulation results to characterize the agents. Finally, a simple application of the metamodel is presented, based upon the use of Industry Foundation Classes. \copyright{} 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

After the elections were called, we employed an original survey via Twitter of these political tweeters to answer the question, who tweets about politics? Unsurprisingly, the results of our logit analysis demonstrate that strong partisans and those exhibiting high levels of traditional political participation activity tweet about politics most often which supports those who argue that we can expect to find the same political activists online as offline. However, we also find evidence that racial minorities and secularists are engaged in the electoral conversation on Twitter suggesting that some marginalized groups may have found a political outlet.},

While this work opens new possibilities for machine learning-aided cryptanalysis, it remains unclear how this distinguisher actually works and what information is the machine learning algorithm deducing. The attacker is left with a black-box that does not tell much about the nature of the possible weaknesses of the algorithm tested, while hope is thin as interpretability of deep neural networks is a well-known difficult task.},

We begin by presenting a brief overview of the issues of interest within the classical study of argumentation: in particular, its relationship-in terms of both similarities and important differences-to traditional concepts of logical reasoning and mathematical proof. We continue by outlining how a number of foundational contributions provided the basis for the formulation of argumentation models and their promotion in AI related settings and then consider a number of new themes that have emerged in recent years, many of which provide the principal topics of the research presented in this volume.},

It examines the logic of games: the development of sophisticated modern dynamic logics that model information flow, communication, and interactive structures in games. It also examines logic as games: the idea that logical activities of reasoning and many related tasks can be viewed in the form of games. In doing so, the book takes up the "intelligent interaction" of agents engaging in competitive or cooperative activities and examines the patterns of strategic behavior that arise. It develops modern logical systems that can analyze information-driven changes in players' knowledge and beliefs, and introduces the "Theory of Play" that emerges from the combination of logic and game theory. This results in a new view of logic itself as an interactive rational activity based on reasoning, perception, and communication that has particular relevance for games. Logic in Games, based on a course taught by the author at Stanford University, the University of Amsterdam, and elsewhere, can be used in advanced seminars and as a resource for researchers.},

We use the recent Irish General Election as a case study for investigating the potential to model political sentiment through mining of social media. Our approach combines sentiment analysis using supervised learning and volume-based measures. We evaluate against the conventional election polls and the final election result. We find that social analytics using both volume-based measures and sentiment analysis are predictive and we make a number of observations related to the task of monitoring public sentiment during an election campaign, including examining a variety of sample sizes, time periods as well as methods for qualitatively exploring the underlying content.},

We provide some basic definitions for arguments, and various kinds of counter-arguments (defeaters). This leads us to the definition of canonical undercuts which we argue are the only defeaters that we need to take into account. We then motivate and formalise the notion of argument trees and argument structures which provide a way of exhaustively collating arguments and counter-arguments. We use argument structures as the basis of our general proposal for argument aggregation. There are a number of frameworks for modelling argumentation in logic. They incorporate formal representation of individual arguments and techniques for comparing conflicting arguments. In these frameworks, if there are a number of arguments for and against a particular conclusion, an aggregation function determines whether the conclusion is taken to hold. We propose a generalisation of these frameworks. In particular, our new framework makes it possible to define aggregation functions that are sensitive to the number of arguments for or against. We compare our framework with a number of other types of argument systems, and finally discuss an application in reasoning with structured news reports. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

The object technology revolution has allowed the replacement of the over twenty-year-old step-wise procedural decomposition paradigm with the more fashionable object composition paradigm. Surprisingly, this evolution seems to have triggered another even more radical change, the current trend toward model transformation. A concrete example is the Object Management Group's rapid move from its previous Object Management Architecture vision to the latest Model-Driven Architecture. This paper proposes an interpretation of this evolution through abstract investigation. In order to stay as language-independent as possible, we have employed the neutral formalism of Sowa's conceptual graphs to describe the various situations characterizing this organization. This will allow us to identify potential problems in the proposed modeling framework and suggest some possible solutions.},

  abstract = {The fixation of formal education to measure and certify academic attainment, continues to fuel the ubiquity of standardised assessment procedures. As such, educators are reluctant to embrace the same constructivist and novel stance adopted towards learning to the assessment domain and continue to favour summative over formative practices. On the other hand, literature on games in education, suggests that well-designed digital games support and enhance the positive interplay between the different forms and functions of assessment, which are inherent to the learning environment. This paper examines the principles of good game design in light of the constructive interaction that exists between learning and the different functions of assessment in games. For instance, levelling and collecting badges whilst climbing up the ladder of challenges found in games, can be considered as the outcome of a purely summative assessment of the player's progress, as the information collected during gameplay is solely used to judge and certify the player's performance. However and more importantly, both for the game designers and the players, the game is continuously producing immediate performance feedback in the form of, amongst others, both on-demand and just-in-time information, which informs the players' learning and allows them to adjust their actions, thus serving as a formative assessment of gameplay. On analysing the respective literature in the field of game studies and assessment, this paper discusses a number of game elements and core mechanics, under three broad themes, namely (i) adaptivity (ii) feedforward and (iii) distributed cognition, which game designers successfully deploy in good game designs. These are gradually and naturally extended towards the theoretical and practical underpinning of an assessment for learning pedagogy, thus potentially informing and transforming traditional assessment practices into a more playful experience.},

Amidst the pandemic, Telemedicine has the potential to help by permitting patients to receive supportive care without having to physically visit a hospital by using a conversational artificial intelligence-based application for their treatment. Thus, telehealth will rapidly and radically transform in-person care to remote consultation of patients. Because of this, it developed a Multilingual Conversational Bot based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) to provide free primary healthcare education, information, advice to chronic patients. The study introduces a novel computer application acting as a personal virtual doctor that has been opportunely designed and extensively trained to interact with patients like human beings. This application is based upon a serverless architecture and it aggregates the services of a doctor by providing preventive measures, homeremedies, interactive counseling sessions, healthcare tips, and symptoms covering the most prevalent diseases in rural India. The paper proposes a conversational bot ``Aapka Chikitsak'' on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for delivering telehealth in India to increase the patient's access to healthcare knowledge and leverage the potentials of artificial intelligence to bridge the gap of demand and supply of human healthcare providers. This conversational application has resulted in reducing the barriers for access to healthcare facilities and procures intelligent consultations remotely to allow timely care and quality treatment, there by effectively assisting the society.},

These properties are difficult to analyze in real-world scenarios due to performance constraints, metric design, and limitations in existing modeling tools. In our previous work, we proposed the Complex Adaptive Systems Language (CASL) and its associated framework. In this paper, we introduce CASL-SG, a Semantic Group extension for large-scale modeling using relational hierarchies. CASL-SG permits large-scale simulations to be executed on modest hardware by enabling simulations to contain approximately twice as many agents. This achieves a 356\% runtime improvement for a Game of Life model with 4 million cells. CASL-SG also enables designers to model behaviors of collectives that drive the system and entities towards self-organization and adaptability.},

In particular, we focus on the associated optimisation problem of forming cars to minimise the travel cost of the overall system modelling such problem as a graph constrained coalition formation (GCCF) problem, where the set of feasible coalitions is restricted by a graph (i.e., the social network). Moreover, we significantly extend the state of the art algorithm for GCCF, i.e., the CFSS algorithm, to solve our GCCF model of the SR problem. Our empirical evaluation uses a real dataset for both spatial (GeoLife) and social data (Twitter), to validate the applicability of our approach in a realistic application scenario. Empirical results show that our approach computes optimal solutions for systems of medium scale (up to 100 agents) providing significant cost reductions (up to -36.22\%). Moreover, we can provide approximate solutions for very large systems (i.e., up to 2000 agents) and good quality guarantees (i.e., with an approximation ratio of 1.41 in the worst case) within minutes (i.e., 100 seconds).},

  abstract = {Large-scale data analytics using machine learning (ML) underpins many modern data-driven applications. ML systems provide means of specifying and executing these ML workloads in an efficient and scalable manner. Data management is at the heart of many ML systems due to data-driven application characteristics, data-centric workload characteristics, and system architectures inspired by classical data management techniques. In this book, we follow this data-centric view of ML systems and aim to provide a comprehensive overview of data management in ML systems for the end-to-end data science or ML lifecycle. We review multiple interconnected lines of work: (1) ML support in database (DB) systems, (2) DB-inspired ML systems, and (3) ML lifecycle systems. Covered topics include: in-database analytics via query generation and user-defined functions, factorized and statistical-relational learning; optimizing compilers for ML workloads; execution strategies and hardware accelerators; data access methods such as compression, partitioning and indexing; resource elasticity and cloud markets; as well as systems for data preparation for ML, model selection, model management, model debugging, and model serving. Given the rapidly evolving field, we strive for a balance between an up-to-date survey of ML systems, an overview of the underlying concepts and techniques, as well as pointers to open research questions. Hence, this book might serve as a starting point for both systems researchers and developers.},

  abstract = {In this paper we introduce and discuss ten guidelines for the use of normative systems in computer science. We adopt a multiagent sys- tems perspective, because norms are used to coordinate, organize, guide, regulate or control interaction among distributed autonomous systems. The first six guidelines are derived from the computer science literature. From the so-called `normchange' definition of the first workshop on nor- mative multiagent systems in 2005 we derive the guidelines to motivate which definition of normative multiagent system is used, to make explicit why norms are a kind of (soft) constraints deserving special analysis, and to explain why and how norms can be changed at runtime. From the so-called `mechanism design' definition of the second workshop on nor- mative multiagent systems in 2007 we derive the guidelines to discuss the use and role of norms as a mechanism in a game-theoretic setting, clarify the role of norms in the multiagent system, and to relate the no- tion of ``norm'' to the legal, social, or moral literature. The remaining four guidelines follow from the philosophical literature: use norms also to resolve dilemmas, and in general to coordinate, organize, guide, regulate or control interaction among agents, distinguish norms from obligations, prohibitions and permissions, use the deontic paradoxes only to illustrate the normative multiagent system, and consider regulative norms in rela- tion to other kinds of norms and other social-cognitive computer science concepts.},

Second, it presents several examples of applications to different economic phenomena where agent-based models are crucial in answering the research question and in solving practical problems emerged in business and policy domains (e.g., financial markets, cooperation dynamics, public policy evaluation). With this book, readers learn what agent-based models are and the advantages they can provide. Further, readers learn how to develop from scratch and with scientific rigor their own agent-based models for studying economic phenomena. Finally, readers find in the book several applications that can represent examples to be imitated and to be kept as reference.},

In software engineering, usual top-down approaches become inadequate to design such systems.

This bottom-up approach provides adaptive, scalable, and robust systems.

This paper presents a framework for serious game design, which aims to reduce the design complexity at both conceptual, technical and practical levels. The approach focuses on a relevant subset of serious games, labelled scenario-based games. At the conceptual level it identifies the basic elements that make up the static game configuration; it also describes the game dynamics, i.e. the state changes of the various game components in the course of time. At the technical level it presents a basic system architecture, which comprises various building tools. Various building tools will be explained and illustrated with technical implementations that are part of the Emergo toolkit for scenario-based game development. At the practical level, a set of design principles are presented for controlling and reducing game design complexity. The principles cover the topics of game structure, feedback and game representation, respectively. Practical application of the framework and the associated toolkit is briefly reported and evaluated.},

  abstract = {This paper analyses the main research direction for the digital transformation of manufacturing and its important drivers: cloud services and resource virtualization that have led to the new Cloud Manufacturing (CMfg) model -- an industrial replica of Cloud Computing. This model is adopted for the higher layer of the Manufacturing Execution System (e.g. the centralised, hierarchical System Scheduler), while its lower layers distribute intelligence through agent- and service orientation in the holonic paradigm. In this approach, Intelligent Manufacturing Systems are assimilated to Cyber-Physical Production Systems in which informational and operational technologies are merged, the shop floor physical reality being mirrored by virtual counterparts -- the digital twins that represent abstract entities specific for the manufacturing domain: products, orders and resources. Industry 4.0 represents the vision for the Industry of the Future which is based on Cyber-Physical Production Systems that assure the flexible, dynamically reconfigurable control of strongly coupled processes. In this picture of the future manufacturing industry, the Industrial Internet of Things framework provides connectivity and interoperability to integrate communications between different kinds of things: products, orders and resources and legacy manufacturing devices to the web service ecosystem. The paper describes the scientific issues related to big data processing, analytics and intelligent decision making through machine learning in predictive resource maintenance, optimized production planning and control, lists solutions and proposes new research directions.},

The typical goals of ABM social science researchers are discussed along with the culture-dish nature of their computer experiments. The applicability of ABM for science more generally is also considered, with special attention to physics. Finally, two distinct types of ABM applications are summarized in order to illustrate concretely the duality of ABM: Real-world systems can not only be simulated with verisimilitude using ABM; they can also be efficiently and robustly designed and constructed on the basis of ABM principles.},

In this paper we compare and discuss the different technologies used in the chatbots which have won the Loebner Prize Competition, the first formal instantiation of the Turing Test. Although there was no game changing breakthrough in the chatbot technologies, it is obvious they evolved from the very simple pattern matching systems towards complicated patterns combined with ontologies and knowledge bases enabling computer reasoning.},

  abstract = {The Social Web (including services such as MySpace, Flickr, last.fm, and WordPress) has captured the attention of millions of users as well as billions of dollars in investment and acquisition. Social websites, evolving around the connections between people and their objects of interest, are encountering boundaries in the areas of information integration, dissemination, reuse, portability, searchability, automation and demanding tasks like querying. The Semantic Web is an ideal platform for interlinking and performing operations on diverse person- and object-related data available from the Social Web, and has produced a variety of approaches to overcome the boundaries being experienced in Social Web application areas. After a short overview of both the Social Web and the Semantic Web, Breslin et al. describe some popular social media and social networking applications, list their strengths and limitations, and describe some applications of Semantic Web technology to address their current shortcomings by enhancing them with semantics. Across these social websites, they demonstrate a twofold approach for interconnecting the islands that are social websites with semantic technologies, and for powering semantic applications with rich community-created content. They conclude with observations on how the application of Semantic Web technologies to the Social Web is leading towards the "Social Semantic Web" (sometimes also called "Web 3.0"), forming a network of interlinked and semantically-rich content and knowledge. The book is intended for computer science professionals, researchers, and graduates interested in understanding the technologies and research issues involved in applying Semantic Web technologies to social software. Practitioners and developers interested in applications such as blogs, social networks or wikis will also learn about methods for increasing the levels of automation in these forms of Web communication.},

FOAF integrates three kinds of network: social networks of human collaboration, friendship and association; representational networks that describe a simplified view of a cartoon universe in factual terms, and information networks that use Web-based linking to share independently published descriptions of this inter-connected world. FOAF does not compete with socially-oriented Web sites; rather it provides an approach in which different sites can tell different parts of the larger story, and by which users can retain some control over their information in a non-proprietary format.},

The main functional features include: representation of complex epi- sodes (e.g. cooking a dinner) over long intervals (days) in large environments (house), forgetting based on emotional importance of episodes, and development of search strategies for objects in the environment.},

However, poker in particular is traditionally played with more than two players. Multiplayer games present fundamental additional issues beyond those in two-player games, and multiplayer poker is a recognized AI milestone.

While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of GPT-3 in general.},

Subsequently, we devise the main communication requirements for those processes and for their integration in the Internet as web services.

A chatbot represents machine that answers questions using Natural Language Processing (NLP). Formulating natural language answers to the questions. Chatbots create a difference in the world of nursing and provide a simple way to handle people from professional organizations. Health chatbots are capable of running one-on-one patient communications and of reviewing specific patient queries.

  abstract = {Cloud gaming in recent years has gained growing success in delivering games-as-a-service by leveraging cloud resources. Existing cloud gaming frameworks deploy the entire game engine within Virtual Machines (VMs) due to the tight-coupling of game engine subsystems (graphics, physics, AI). The effectiveness of such an approach is heavily dependant on the cloud VM providing consistently high levels of performance, availability, and reliability. However this assumption is difficult to guarantee due to QoS degradation within, and outside of, the cloud - from system failure, network connectivity, to consumer datacaps - all of which may result in game service outage. We present a cloud gaming framework that creates a distributed game engine via loose-coupling the graphical renderer from the game engine, allowing for its execution across cloud VMs and client devices dynamically. Our framework allows games to operate during performance degradation and cloud service failure, enabling game developers to exploit heterogeneous graphical APIs unrestricted from Operating System and hardware constraints. Our initial experiments show that our framework improves game frame rates by up to 33\% via frame interlacing between cloud and client systems},

But knowledge is often tacit: It lives in the minds of individuals, and therefore, it is difficult to transfer it to another person by means of the written word or verbal expression. This paper addresses this important problem by introducing a methodology, consisting of a four-step process that facilitates tacit to explicit knowledge conversion. The methodology utilizes conceptual modeling, thus enabling understanding and reasoning through visual knowledge representation. This implies the possibility of understanding concepts and ideas, visualized through conceptual models, without using linguistic or algebraic means. The proposed methodology is conducted in a metamodel-based tool environment whose aim is efficient application and ease of use.},

This paper first presents a values-driven model for self-organization in which the expected emergent properties of a system are specified as the social values while the social values are realized via implicitly inducing members to regulate their individual values and adjust their behaviors to fit the expectations of the system. Based on the values-driven self-organization, this paper proposes an automated coordination mechanism for decentralized MASs. In this mechanism, by indirectly changing the difficulties in acquiring resources (which may be delegated to some special agents since MASs generally do not have substantial bodies), MASs can lead agents to regulate their values to be consistent with the social values of MASs so that the coordination of MASs can spontaneously emerge from the local behaviors of agents. Finally, this paper implements a simulation traffic system using the coordination mechanism based on values-driven self-organization to validate the emergence of coordination among multiple agents.},

  abstract = {The term ``gamification'' is generally used to denote the application of game mechanisms in non-gaming environments with the aim of enhancing the processes enacted and the experience of those involved. In recent years, gamification has become a catchword throughout the fields of education and training, thanks to its perceived potential to make learning more motivating and engaging. This paper is an attempt to shed light on the emergence and consolidation of gamification in education/training. It reports the results of a literature review that collected and analysed around 120 papers on the topic published between 2011 and 2014. These originate from different countries and deal with gamification both in training contexts and in formal educational, from primary school to higher education. The collected papers were analysed and classified according to various criteria, including target population, type of research (theoretical vs experimental), kind of educational contents delivered, and the tools deployed. The results that emerge from this study point to the increasing popularity of gamification techniques applied in a wide range of educational settings. At the same time, it appears that over the last few years the concept of gamification has become more clearly defined in the minds of researchers and practitioners. Indeed, until fairly recently the term was used by many to denote the adoption of game artefacts (especially digital ones) as educational tools for learning a specific subject such as algebra. In other words, it was used as a synonym of Game Based Learning (GBL) rather than to identify an educational strategy informing the overall learning process, which is treated globally as a game or competition. However, this terminological confusion appears only in a few isolated cases in this literature review, suggesting that a certain level of taxonomic and epistemological convergence is underway.},

  abstract = {One of the main advancements in distributed learning may be the idea behind Google's Federated Learning (FL) algorithm. It trains copies of artificial neural networks (ANN) in a distributed way and recombines the weights and biases obtained in a central server. Each unit maintains the privacy of the information since the training datasets are not shared. This idea perfectly fits a Multi-Agent System, where the units learning and sharing the model are agents. FL is a centralized approach, where a server is in charge of receiving, averaging and distributing back the models to the different units making the learning process. In this work, we propose a truly distributed learning process where all the agents have the same role in the system. We suggest using a consensus-based learning algorithm that we call Co-Learning. This process uses a consensus process to share the ANN models each agent learns using its private data and calculates the aggregated model. Co-Learning, as a consensus-based algorithm, calculates the average of the ANN models shared by the agents with their local neighbors. This iterative process converges to the averaged ANN model as a central server does. Apart from the definition of the Co-Learning algorithm, the paper presents its integration in SPADE agents, along with a framework called FIVE allowing to develop Intelligent Virtual Environments for SPADE agents. This framework has been used to test the execution of SPADE agents using Co-Learning algorithm in a simulation of an orange orchard field.},

It converted the Japanese role-playing game into an international gaming standard with enhanced gameplay, spectacular cutscenes and a vast narrative involving an iconic cast. In the decades after its release, the Final Fantasy VII franchise has grown to encompass a number of video game sequels, prequels, a feature-length film, a novel and a multi-volume remake series. This volume, the first edited collection of essays devoted only to the world of Final Fantasy VII, blends scholarly rigor with fan passion in order to identify the elements that keep Final Fantasy VII current and exciting for players. Some essays specifically address the game's perennially relevant themes and scenarios, ranging from environmental consciousness to economic inequity and posthumanism. Others examine the mechanisms used to immerse the player or to improve the narrative. Finally, there are several essays devoted specifically to the game's legacy, from its influence on later games to its characters' many crossovers and cameos.},

Workers and work teams in knowledge-intensive enterprises are often involved in creative tasks that are carried out jointly and involve team members with diversified competencies exchanging knowledge related to their projects and assignments to create innovative outcomes. We investigate some popular creativity-enhancing techniques in the perspective of their use as catalysts for knowledge transfer in this context. We assess whether the use of these techniques may alleviate the limitations imposed on global virtual team members by their use of telecommunications and collaborative work tools that might otherwise adversely affect the effectiveness of the knowledge transfer. These techniques are designed to be used indi- vidually, by groups or within a virtual community. The physical and temporal separation of the global virtual team members does not hinder the knowledge-intensive dimension of these enterprises when aided by creativity-stimulating techniques. Therefore, we suggest that global virtual teams making use of creativity-enhancing techniques may be more efficient in transferring complex knowledge. Keywords},

Based on this initial research, the first model version was generated, according to the procedures indicated by the EKD methodology. Subsequently, this first model version was submitted for analyses, appraisal and validation, resulting in the final model version. This model is composed of sub-models of goals, rules, concepts, processes, actors, resources, requirements and technical components providing a holistic and systemic vision of knowledge management. The model may serve as a guide for organizations that aim to implement or improve their KM activities. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

Distributed multi-agent systems are used as a way to represent virtual cluster members. The mechanisms are illustrated, and static and dynamic virtual clusters are compared. Dynamic reconfiguration is achieved by varying the time periods for which clustering is performed. The proposed clustering mechanisms demonstrate that large-scale centralized energy systems can operate in a decentralized fashion when only local information is available.},

  abstract = {The present urban transportation system, mostly tailored for cars, has long shown its limitations. In many urban areas, public transportation and soft mobility would be able to effectively satisfy many travel needs. However, they tend to be neglected, due to a deep-rooted car dependency. How can we encourage people to make sustainable mobility choices, reducing car use and the related CO2 emissions and energy consumption? Taking advantage of the wide availability of smartphone devices, we designed GoEco!, a smartphone application exploiting automatic mobility tracking, eco-feedback, social comparison and gamification elements to persuade individual modal change. We tested the effectiveness of GoEco! in two regions of Switzerland (Cantons Ticino and Zurich), in a large-scale, one year long randomized controlled trial. Notwithstanding a large drop-out rate experienced throughout the experiment, GoEco! was observed to produce a statistically significant impact (a decrease in CO2 emissions and energy consumption per kilometer) for systematic routes in highly car-dependent urban areas, such as the Canton Ticino. In Zurich, instead, where high quality public transport is already available, no statistically significant effects were found. In this paper we present the GoEco! experiment and discuss its results and the lessons learnt, highlighting practical difficulties in performing randomized controlled trials in the field of mobility and providing recommendations for future research.},

The app features and contents are grounded in the transtheoretical model for behaviour change and were designed to avoid over-reliance on ``one-size-fits-all'', simplistic point-based systems. The GoEco! app was designed in a user centred approach and was field-tested in Switzerland in a three-month experiment involving around 150 voluntary users. In this paper, we present the app's features and comment on their evaluation from the perspective of the field-testers. The insights we collected through an online questionnaire and individual interviews allowed us to develop recommendations for similar persuasive apps and to identify open challenges for the future. In particular, we recommend to endow such apps with multi-modal travel planning components and features evoking the feeling of belonging to a community, that provide support and helping relationships.},

  abstract = {Video games have become an increasingly popular and influential form of entertainment in recent years, with a growing market and diverse range of players. As a result, there is a need to better understand and improve various aspects of the video game industry, including storytelling, localisation, and immersion. Storytelling in video games refers to the use of narrative elements, such as character development, plot, and dialogue, to create a compelling and engaging experience. Localisation involves adapting a game for different cultural and linguistic audiences, which can be a complex process that requires careful consideration of the original content and the target audience. This can include translation, voice acting, and other modifications to ensure a seamless and enjoyable experience for players. Immersion refers to the extent to which the player feels fully absorbed and engaged in the game world and its gameplay. By understanding and addressing these three areas, game developers can create more engaging and successful games for players around the world. This study focuses on the interrelated areas of storytelling, localisation, and immersion within the context of role-playing games, using The Witcher III: Wild Hunt as a case study. The study used 41 participants who played the game in both English and Brazilian-Portuguese localised versions and completed questionnaires and interviews about their perceptions of these three areas. The results of the study offer recommendations for improving graphic design in video games and suggest the need to explore whether the impact of localisation on story and immersion is dependent only on language or influenced by other factors.},

  abstract = {The design of collaborative learning (CL) scenarios that increase both students' learning and motivation is a challenge that the CSCL community has been addressing in the past few years. On one hand, CSCL design (i.e. scripts) has been shown to be effective to support meaningful interactions and better learning. On the other hand, scripted collaboration often does not motivate students to participate in the CL process, which makes more difficult the use of group activities over time. To deal with the problem of motivation, researchers and educators are now looking at gamification techniques to engage students. Gamification is an interesting concept that deals with the introduction and use of game design elements in a proper way to satisfy individual motivational needs. The use of gamification in educational settings is a complex task that requires, from instructional designers, knowledge about game elements (such as leaderboards and point systems), game design (e.g. how to combine game elements) and their impact on motivation and learning. Today, to the best of our knowledge, there are no approaches for the formal systematization of the instructional design knowledge about gamification and its application in CL scenarios. Thus, to address this issue, we have applied ontological engineering techniques to develop an Ontology called OntoGaCLeS. In this paper, we present the main concepts and ontological structure used to represent gamified CL scenarios. In this ontology, we formalize the representation of gamification concepts and explain how they affect motivation in the context of collaborative learning. Particularly, we will focus on the definition of player roles and gameplay strategies. Furthermore, to show the utility of our approach, we illustrate how to use our ontology to define a personalized gamification model that is used to gamify a CL scenario based on motivational needs and individual traits of learners in a group.},

  abstract = {Planning for ad hoc teamwork is challenging because it involves agents collaborating without any prior coordination or communication. The focus is on principled methods for a single agent to cooperate with others. This motivates investigating the ad hoc teamwork problem in the context of self-interested decision-making frameworks. Agents engaged in individual decision making in multiagent settings face the task of having to reason about other agents' actions, which may in turn involve reasoning about others. An established approximation that operationalizes this approach is to bound the infinite nesting from below by introducing level 0 models. For the purposes of this study, individual, self-interested decision making in multiagent settings is modeled using interactive dynamic influence diagrams (I-DID). These are graphical models with the benefit that they naturally offer a factored representation of the problem, allowing agents to ascribe dynamic models to others and reason about them. We demonstrate that an implication of bounded, finitely-nested reasoning by a self-interested agent is that we may not obtain optimal team solutions in cooperative settings, if it is part of a team. We address this limitation by including models at level 0 whose solutions involve reinforcement learning. We show how the learning is integrated into planning in the context of I-DIDs. This facilitates optimal teammate behavior, and we demonstrate its applicability to ad hoc teamwork on several problem domains and configurations.},

  abstract = {The agent-based approach views an organization as a collection of agents, interacting with one another in their pursuit of assigned tasks. The performance of an organization in this framework is determined by the formal and informal structures of interactions among agents, which define the lines of communication, allocation of information processing tasks, distribution of decision-making authorities, and the provision of incentives. This chapter provides a synthesis of various agent-based models of organizations and surveys some of the new insights that are being delivered. The ultimate goal is to introduce the agent-based approach to economists in a methodological manner and provide a broader and less idiosyncratic perspective to those who are already engaging in this line of work. The chapter is organized around the set of research questions that are common to this literature: (1) What are the determinants of organizational behavior and performance? (2) How does organizational structure influence performance? (3) How do the skills and traits of agents matter and how do they interact with structure? (4) How do the characteristics of the environment---including its stability, complexity, and competitiveness---influence the appropriate allocation of authority and information? (5) How is the behavior and performance influenced when an organization is coevolving with other organizations from which it can learn? (6) Can an organization evolve its way to a better structure?},

The study data were gathered from 409 respondents in China. The exploratory factor analysis yielded a gratification structure of five factors (mobility, entertainment, sociability, achievement, and relaxation). According to Young's (1998) classic definition, 7.3\% of the participants in the study sample were considered addicts. They were characterized as lonely, leisurely bored, and motivated by the mobile nature of the game. As expected, frequent players had a higher tendency to become addicts. In particular, loneliness and self-control were significant predictors of mobile social game addiction, whereas leisure boredom was linked to the intensity of game use. The limitations of the study and its implications for future research are discussed.},

  abstract = {Using digital learning to assist in-service employees in promoting language skills has become an efficient way that can save training costs and profits. However, the employees' language learning performance often is not as expected due to low learning motivation, willingness, and persistence. Therefore, this study developed a game-based Japanese learning system based on the Octalysis gamification framework proposed by Chou (2016) to facilitate enterprise employees' learning effectiveness of Japanese as a second language (L2). All the eight core drives of the Octalysis gamification framework were adopted in the design of the learning functions and gamification mechanisms, including ``epic meaning and calling,'' ``development and accomplishment,'' ``empowerment of creativity and feedback,'' ``ownership and possession,'' ``social influence and relatedness,'' ``scarcity and impatience,'' ``unpredictability and curiosity,'' and ``loss and avoid\- ance.'' This study used a true experimental design and recruited 54 Taiwanese employees from a Taiwan branch of an international Japanese business company to conduct a two-week experi\- ment. The research participants were randomly assigned as the experimental and control groups respectively, using a Japanese learning system with or without a game-based design to support their Japanese learning. This study confirmed that the game-based Japanese learning system could significantly enhance the learners' engagement in learning behaviors, learning perfor\- mance, learning motivation, and immersion experience. In addition, for most learning functions designed by applying the core drives regarded as intrinsic motivators in the Octalysis gamification framework, the more frequently the learners used the functions, the better they performed in learning performance. Moreover, several learning functions designed by employing positive or negative motivators also had significant positive correlations between the number of use and learning performance. This study contributes to the digital game-based language learning field by applying the Octalysis gamification framework to design an effective game-based Japanese learning system for company employees and examine the correlations between the use of the learning functions and learning performance.},

  abstract = {The theory of argumentation is a rich, interdisciplinary area of research straddling the fields of artificial intelligence, philosophy, communication studies, linguistics, and psychology. In the last years, significant progress has been made in understanding the theoretical properties of different argumentation logics. However, one major barrier to the development and practical deployment of argumentation systems is the lack of a shared, agreed notation or ``interchange format'' for argumentation and arguments. This article describes a draft specification for an Argument Interchange Format (AIF) intended for representation and exchange of data between various argumentation tools and agent-based applications. It represents a consensus `abstract model' established by researchers across fields of argumentation, artificial intelligence and multi-agent systems.1 In its current form, this specification is intended as a starting point for further discussion and elaboration by the community, rather than an attempt at a definitive, all encompassing model. However, to demonstrate proof of concept, a use case scenario is briefly described. Moreover, three concrete realisations or `reifications' of the abstract model are illustrated.},

  abstract = {This article describes the ICAP framework that defines cognitive engagement activities on the basis of students' overt behaviors and proposes that engagement behaviors can be categorized and differentiated into one of four modes: Interactive, Constructive, Active, and Passive. The ICAP hypothesis predicts that as students become more engaged with the learning materials, from passive to active to constructive to interactive, their learning will increase. We suggest possible knowledge-change processes that support the ICAP hypothesis and address the limitations and caveats of the hypothesis. In addition, empirical validation for the hypothesis is provided by examining laboratory and classroom studies that focus on three specific engagement activities: note taking, concept mapping and self-explaining. We also consider how ICAP can be used as a tool for explaining discrepant findings, dictate the proper choice of a control condition, and evaluate students' outputs. Finally, we briefly compare ICAP to existing theories of learning.}

  abstract = {Some of the most interesting questions one can ask about early societies, are about people and their relations, and the nature and scale of their organization. In this work, we attempt to answer such questions with approaches introduced by multiagent systems. Specifically, we developed a generic agent-based model (ABM) for simulating ancient societies. Unlike most existing ABMs used in archaeology, our model includes agents that are autonomous and utility-based. Our model can (and does) also incorporate different social organization paradigms and technologies used in ancient societies. Equipped with such paradigms, our model allows us to explore the transition from a simple to a more complex society by focusing on the historical social dynamics---i.e., the flexibility and evolution of power relationships depending on social context and time. As a case study, we employ our model to evaluate the impact of the implemented social and technological paradigms on an artificial Early Bronze Age ``Minoan'' society located at a particular region of the island of Crete. Model parameter choices are based on archaeological evidence and studies, but are not biased towards any specific assumption. Results over a number of different simulation scenarios demonstrate an impressive sustainability for settlements consisting of and adopting a socio-economic organization model based on self-organization, and which was inspired by a recent framework for modern self-organizing agent organizations. This is the first time a self-organization approach is incorporated in an archaeology ABM system.},

  abstract = {Storytelling has always been a crucial part of education and caring of children throughout human history. Even in modern ages with advanced digital technologies and multimedia contents, the educational impact of storytelling for children is still very important. However, modern parents have less time for reading books for their children. The development of audiobooks and automatic speech recognition technology enabled a type of automatic storytelling without the burden of parents. However, the educational and psychological benefits of storytelling are not only in passive listening but also in an interactive exchange of interchanging questions and answers regarding the story. In this paper, I developed a prototype system of interactive storytelling utilizing encoder-decoder style neural network dialog system. I conducted a user study with the system and found out that the interactive dialog is useful for better understanding and satisfaction of users. I suggested another program involving dynamic narrative storytelling. With this feature, the answers given by children can change the storyline in logical and natural manner so that the children can build their decision making and communication capabilities. I believe that children's education could be vastly improved by applying artificial intelligence to storytelling, as studied and demonstrated in this paper.},

  abstract = {Previous emotion studies in education have focused mainly on the superiority of positive emotion for learning performance (e.g., enjoyment) over negative emotion (e.g., fear). However, few studies have considered different arousal levels in terms of learners' emotion. For example, the effects of calm positive or negative emotion have not been discussed, when compared to arousing positive or negative emotion. Based on the limited Capacity model of motivated mediated message processing (LC4MP), this study investigated how learners' emotional valence and arousal, induced by video clips, influenced their learning performance and mental effort in an animated instruction with different modalities (written-text versus spoken-text). A total of 206 participants were randomly assigned to eight groups: (a) calm positive, (b) calm negative (c) arousing positive, and (d) arousing negative emotions under different modality conditions (written and spoken). The results showed that both arousing groups outperformed calm groups on a recall test only in the written-text group regardless of valence, while emotional valence and arousal did not significantly influence learning performance in the spoken-text group. The results provide partial support for the LC4MP model and imply that the arousing emotional state has the potential to enhance multimedia learning.},

A prompting service which supplies such information is not a satisfactory solution. Activities of users at terminals and most application programs should remain unaffected when the internal representation of data is changed and even when some aspects of the external representation are changed. Changes in data representation will often be needed as a result of changes in query, update, and report traffic and natural growth in the types of stored information. Existing noninferential, formatted data systems provide users with tree-structured files or slightly more general network models of the data. In Section 1, inadequacies of these models are discussed. A model based on n-ary relations, a normal form for data base relations, and the concept of a universal data sublanguage are introduced. In Section 2, certain operations on relations (other than logical inference) are discussed and applied to the problems of redundancy and consistency in the user's model.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates how self-organization can be supported at the level of the urban neighborhood, based on the interactions of neighborhood inhabitants using a prototyped and implemented social computing application called ZWERM1. According to Vasileva (2012), ``Social Computing Applications'' (SCA) allow users to discuss various topics in online forums, share their thoughts in blogs, share photos, videos, bookmarks, and connect with friends through social networks.'' (Vasileva, 2012, p178). From the description, we can infer that SCA is a very similar concept to what is often called social media. Many initiatives exist that try to get people to know each other and do things together at the local level, but the number of digital systems that aim for this is limited. Even fewer are the systems that try to support selforganization. Heylighen et al (in presss) introduces the concept of the ``mobilization system'', which can be defined as: ``a socio-technological system that motivates and coordinates people to work towards a given objective'' (Heylighen et al in press, p2). In this definition, the elements of coordination and motivation are important. Heylighen (2012) mentions amongst others gamification as an approach to create mobilization systems. From a societal point of view, such a system should act under the principle of libertarian paternalism, inciting people to do what is good for the collective, without law enforcement The focus of this paper is on how to support local self-organization in urban neighborhoods through a SCA mobilization system that uses gamification. To achieve this, two main objectives were put forward. Firstly, people should get to know each other. This is what we refer to as consolidating social capital. Secondly, this social capital should be made to act as the basis on which action can be undertaken. This is what we mean when we refer to the activation of social capital. Combining the above, the paper addresses the following central research question: ``How can both the activation and the consolidation of social capital be achieved through the coordination and motivation elements that are typically found in mobilization systems built as social computing applications, in order to stimulate self-organization in urban neighborhoods?''},

  abstract = {This paper explores principles governing the rational balance among an agent's beliefs, goals, actions, and intentions. Such principles provide specificationsfor artificial agents, and approximate a theory of human action (as philosophers use the term). By making explicit the conditions under which an agent can drop his goals, i.e., by specifying how the agent is committed to his goals, the formalism captures a number of important properties of intention. Specifically, the formalism provides analysesfor Bratman's three characteristicfunctional roles played by intentions [7, 9], and shows how agents can avoid intending all the foreseen side-effects of what they actually intend. Finally, the analysis shows how intentions can be adopted relative to a background of relevant beliefs and other intentions or goals. By relativizing one agent's intentions in terms of beliefs about another agent's intentions (or beliefs'), we derive a preliminary account of interpersonal commitments.},

This study explored the social interactions that occur both within and outside of MMORPGs. The sample consisted of 912 self-selected MMORPG players from 45 countries. MMORPGs were found to be highly socially interactive environments providing the opportunity to create strong friendships and emotional relationships. The study demonstrated that the social interactions in online gaming form a considerable element in the enjoyment of playing. The study showed MMORPGs can be extremely social games, with high percentages of gamers making life-long friends and partners. It was concluded that virtual gaming may allow players to express themselves in ways they may not feel comfortable doing in real life because of their appearance, gender, sexuality, and/or age. MMORPGs also offer a place where teamwork, encouragement, and fun can be experienced.},

The recommendations are intended to provide interesting elements to users. Recommender systems can be developed using different techniques and algorithms where the selection of these techniques depends on the area in which they will be applied. This paper proposes a recommender system in the leisure domain, specifically in the movie showtimes domain. The system proposed is called RecomMetz, and it is a context-aware mobile recommender system based on Semantic Web technologies. In detail, a domain ontology primarily serving a semantic similarity metric adjusted to the concept of ``packages of single items'' was developed in this research. In addition, location, crowd and time were considered as three different kinds of contextual information in RecomMetz. In a nutshell, RecomMetz has unique features: (1) the items to be recommended have a composite structure (movie theater + movie + showtime), (2) the integration of the time and crowd factors into a context-aware model, (3) the implementation of an ontology-based context modeling approach and (4) the development of a multi-platform native mobile user interface intended to leverage the hardware capabilities (sensors) of mobile devices. The evaluation results show the efficiency and effectiveness of the recommendation mechanism implemented by RecomMetz in both a cold-start scenario and a no cold-start scenario.},

Recent moves toward utilizing blended options to support face-to-face classes with online materials are beneficial, but using solely online classes may not produce similar learning gains. During 2020, the global pandemic meant a loss of face-to-face teaching, such that laboratory classes were rapidly transitioned to online delivery. This study explores the impact of this shift on undergraduate students, evaluating their use of the online laboratory classes and the impact this had on their examination performance and their perceptions of learning. Student use of the online laboratory classes varied, with those spending more time performing better on examinations. Students valued the online classes, finding them helpful for their learning, but also felt that the lack of face-to-face laboratory classes and interactions with peers and teaching staff was detrimental to their learning experience. Overall, academic performance of online learners was comparable to previous years but may indicate some underlying deficits.},

  abstract = {The widespread adoption of social media for political communication creates unprecedented opportunities to monitor the opinions of large numbers of politically active individuals in real time. However, without a way to distinguish between users of opposing political alignments, conflicting signals at the individual level may, in the aggregate, obscure partisan differences in opinion that are important to political strategy. In this article we describe several methods for predicting the political alignment of Twitter users based on the content and structure of their political communication in the run-up to the 2010 U.S. midterm elections. Using a data set of 1,000 manually-annotated individuals, we find that a support vector machine (SVM) trained on hash tag metadata outperforms an SVM trained on the full text of users' tweets, yielding predictions of political affiliations with 91\&\#x025; accuracy. Applying latent semantic analysis to the content of users' tweets we identify hidden structure in the data strongly associated with political affiliation, but do not find that topic detection improves prediction performance. All of these content-based methods are outperformed by a classifier based on the segregated community structure of political information diffusion networks (95\&\#x025; accuracy). We conclude with a practical application of this machinery to web-based political advertising, and outline several approaches to public opinion monitoring based on the techniques developed herein.},

Simple image- and text-recognition tasks have been successfully 'crowd-sourced' through games, but it is not clear if more complex scientific problems can be solved with human-directed computing. Protein structure prediction is one such problem: locating the biologically relevant native conformation of a protein is a formidable computational challenge given the very large size of the search space. Here we describe Foldit, a multiplayer online game that engages non-scientists in solving hard prediction problems. Foldit players interact with protein structures using direct manipulation tools and user-friendly versions of algorithms from the Rosetta structure prediction methodology, while they compete and collaborate to optimize the computed energy. We show that top-ranked Foldit players excel at solving challenging structure refinement problems in which substantial backbone rearrangements are necessary to achieve the burial of hydrophobic residues. Players working collaboratively develop a rich assortment of new strategies and algorithms; unlike computational approaches, they explore not only the conformational space but also the space of possible search strategies. The integration of human visual problem-solving and strategy development capabilities with traditional computational algorithms through interactive multiplayer games is a powerful new approach to solving computationally-limited scientific problems.},

Main research themes are the construction of game/play space and identities. Within this context I elaborate in this paper on the usefulness of the term magic circle (Johan Huizinga). I will argue why in game research the current use of the term magic circle is problematic. We can understand the term differently when returning to the context in which Huizinga introduced the magic circle as ritual play-ground. According to him ritual is play and play is ritual. Referring back to his work Homo Ludens (1938) I will discuss the various relationships between role-play and ritual performance. I will argue that fantasy role-playing consists of collections of performances or ritual acts, in which players construct the game/play space, identities and meaning.},

The analyses they offer are based on both the firsthand experience of being a resident of Azeroth and the data they have gathered and interpreted.The contributors examine the ways that gameworlds reflect the real world - exploring such topics as World of Warcraft as a "capitalist fairytale" and the game's construction of gender; the cohesiveness of the gameworld in terms of geography, mythology, narrative, and the treatment of death as a temporary state; aspects of play, including "deviant strategies" perhaps not in line with the intentions of the designers; and character - both players' identification with their characters and the game's culture of naming characters." -- BOOK JACKET.},

Before the review, we discuss how to classify the diverse aspects of agent organizations currently captured by organizational models. These aspects are named ``modelling dimensions''. We show that there are at least four basic dimensions: the structural dimension mainly composed of roles and groups, the interactive dimension characterized by dialogical interaction structures, the functional dimension formed by goal/task decomposition, and the normative dimension in which we find the concepts of norms, rights, rules, and so forth. Apart from the basic dimensions, we also identify four other complementary dimensions: environment, evaluation, evolution, and ontology. These are related to the aspects of situatedeness, measurement, adaptation, and domain specific semantics of agent organizations. Finally, we compare the organizational models reviewed and describe how the idea of modelling dimension can help in finding correspondences between organizational models.},

  abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to conceptualise social media usage (SMU) as a contributory, knowledge management (KM) tool towards entrepreneurial behaviour amongst small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Although an underdeveloped concept in entrepreneurship, the conceptual analysis of KM presents evidence which links SMU as complementary to changing KM conventions. Design/methodology/approach The pertinent KM and SMU literatures of the SME context were reviewed to form an understanding of this context. Employing a mixed-methods approach, a pragmatic, thematic investigation of SMU-enhanced KM was facilitated. Findings Substantial benefits of innovative SMU, as a management tool towards SME entrepreneurialism, were witnessed. SMU enhances the administration of real-time knowledge, encouraging creativity. However, longer-term costs of employing requisite personnel, and anticipated organisational restructuring, present challenges. The paper identifies the potentials of social media technologies in overcoming KM issues. The authors propose a reasoned process model towards entrepreneurial exploitation by acknowledging systematic phases of research, concept, institutionalise, develop, target and assess, referred to as the RCIDTA model. Practical implications The authors argue that KM, through social media, facilitates interactions to execute innovative processes within SMEs ever-changing infrastructures. It also informs nascent entrepreneurs, in considering the benefits of systematic KM, and novel SMU, opportunities. The RCIDTA model for SMEs can be utilised in improving knowledge ecosystems of entrepreneurial SMEs, promoting innovation towards sustained organisation growth. Originality/value This paper embraces the growing approach of SMEs applying SMU. SMU and its cost efficiency support the start-up activity. This paper highlights central issues concerning the exploitation of sector-specific KM, including organisational strategy, structure, brand formation, fiscal and personnel resource allocation and market share.},

  abstract = {In the current literature of knowledge management and artificial intelligence, several different approaches have been tried to the problem of developing domain ontologies from scratch. All these approaches deal fundamentally with three problems: (1) providing a collection of general terms describing classes and relations to be employed in the description of the domain itself; (2) organizing the terms into a taxonomy of the classes by the ISA relation; and (3) expressing in an explicit way the constraints that make the ISA pairs meaningful. Though a number of such approaches can be found, no systematic analysis of them exists which can be used to understand the inspiring motivation, the applicability context, and the structure of the approaches. In this chapter, we provide a framework for analyzing the existing methodologies that compare them to a set of general criteria. In particular, we obtain a classification based upon the direction of ontology construction; bottom-up are those methodologies that start with some descriptions of the domain and obtain a classification, while top-down ones start with an abstract view of the domain itself, which is given a priori. The resulting classification is useful not only for theoretical purposes but also in the practice of deployment of ontologies in Information Systems, since it provides a framework for choosing the right methodology to be applied in the specific context, depending also on the needs of the application itself.},

  abstract = {Complex systems may have billion components making consensus formation slow and difficult. Recently several overlapping stories emerged from various disciplines, including protein structures, neuroscience and social networks, showing that fast responses to known stimuli involve a network core of few, strongly connected nodes. In unexpected situations the core may fail to provide a coherent response, thus the stimulus propagates to the periphery of the network. Here the final response is determined by a large number of weakly connected nodes mobilizing the collective memory and opinion, i.e. the slow democracy exercising the 'wisdom of crowds'. This mechanism resembles to Kahneman's "Thinking, Fast and Slow" discriminating fast, pattern-based and slow, contemplative decision making. The generality of the response also shows that democracy is neither only a moral stance nor only a decision making technique, but a very efficient general learning strategy developed by complex systems during evolution. The duality of fast core and slow majority may increase our understanding of metabolic, signaling, ecosystem, swarming or market processes, as well as may help to construct novel methods to explore unusual network responses, deep-learning neural network structures and core-periphery targeting drug design strategies.

The main novelty of this work is in "on the fly" generation of eassessments based on the underlying ontology and predefined question templates that are founded on the Bloom's taxonomy of educational objectives. The main deployment scenario for the framework is a web-service providing collaborative e-learning and knowledge management capabilities to various learning communities.},

Its main thesis is that the impact of innovation on organizational performance depends on compositions of innovation types over time. We examine this proposition by analysing innovative activity in a panel of 428 public service organizations in the UK over four years. Our findings suggest that focus on adopting a specific type of innovation every year is detrimental, consistency in adopting the same composition of innovation types over the years has no effect, and divergence from the industry norm in adopting innovation types could possibly be beneficial to organizational performance.

  abstract = {A serious game is a type of game that is designed for a primary purpose other than entertainment. Instead, serious games are intended to achieve specific goals, such as education, training, or health promotion. The goal of serious games is to engage players in a way that is both enjoyable and effective in achieving the intended learning or behavior change outcomes. Recently, several systematic reviews on the development and application of serious games and on the application of gamification techniques have been published, which indicate high activity and ongoing progress in this area of research. Such an extensive body of review papers raises the need to analyze and extract the current state and the prevailing trends of the serious games and gamification (SGG) domain by analyzing and summarizing the systematic review articles. This study presents a systematic meta-review, i.e., a review of the 53 survey papers on the domain of serious games and gamification. The systematic review follows the PRISMA guidelines, while constructive and cross-sectional methods are used to analyze and present the results. Finally, this study identifies the future trends and challenges for the domain. As a result, the meta-review helps the reader to quickly assess the present status of SGG and serves as a reference for finding further information on each technology utilized in SGG. Using the criterion of the citations, the meta-review analysis provides insight into the quantity and academic relevance of the published SGG articles. Moreover, 53 articles published in journals were selected as important surveys in the research field. The study found that serious games and gamification techniques are increasingly being used for a wide range of health conditions and the focus is shifting towards the use of mobile and digital platforms, virtual reality, and machine learning to personalize and adapt interventions. The existing research gaps include the lack of standardization in development and evaluation, insufficient understanding of underlying mechanisms of action, limited understanding of integration into existing healthcare systems, limited understanding of specific game mechanics and design elements for promoting health behaviors, and limited research on scalability, adoption, and long-term effects. These research gaps highlight the need for further research to fully understand the potential and limitations of serious games and gamification for health and how to effectively apply them.},

  abstract = {Requirements elicitation is one of the most significant activities of requirements engineering (RE) process. Poorly specified requirements can lead to a failed project. Various elicitation techniques are used to elicit requirements from the users and other stakeholders, each having its own pros and cons. Lack of user engagement, less user involvement, textual nature of the requirements, time taking process are some of the major problems that make it difficult to perform elicitation via traditional techniques. Moreover, these problems further create other challenges such as ambiguity, inconsistency, and incompleteness in requirements. Currently, researchers have focused on reducing ambiguity in requirements with the help of different techniques such as natural language processing techniques, requirement templates, and formal methods; however, these techniques work on reducing ambiguity during specification or from specified requirements. One of the ``young' and exciting way of engaging users in requirements elicitation of a system is ``Gamification', which helps in user engagement into the system. We intend to discover how gamification helps in reducing ambiguity by engaging stakeholders in an interactive manner. In this review study, we have reviewed traditional techniques used to detect and reduce requirements ambiguity. On the contrary, we have also presented the significance of gamification in requirements elicitation and the popular but effective game elements used in similar systems. Furthermore, this study highlights the significance of using gamification in requirements elicitation, which is beneficial to software development team as well as the users involved in the system.},

  abstract = {More than 30 years ago, ACM Turing Award winner, Ed Feigenbaum, heralded a revolution in business computing under the banner `knowledge is power'. With this slogan, Feigenbaum brought domain-specific expert systems to the attention of the computing world. Now deployed in shrinkwrapped tax preparation programs, embedded in one of the world's best selling software products, and estimated to be in use by over two-thirds of Fortune 500 companies, the expert system gains its power by the use of the specific knowledge of a domain that is encoded in its rules -- be it rules about tax laws, rules about the spelling of words, or the specific business rules dictating how your market sector operates. In all these systems, this special-purpose knowledge is where the power is derived. In the past decade, however, a newagenda has been evolving as part of research in what is now known as the SemanticWeb. This approach might also be called `knowledge is power,' but with a significantly differentmetaphor.Where Feigenbaum envisioned power akin to the power of a sledgehammer, the new paradigm makes knowledge akin to the power flowing through the electrical grid. Rather than the centralized power coming from carefully engineered knowledge bases aimed at specific applications, the new power flows through the routers of the Internet, as electricity flows through the wires in your wall. Knowledge, in this view, becomes as distributed, dynamic and ubiquitous as the power flowing into the lamp by which you are reading these words. The Semantic Web vision, per se, is rightly attributed to Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of theweb and coiner of the term`SemanticWeb,' but hewas not the first or only one to realize the strength of the new knowledge is power metaphor. A small group of researchers, branching out from the traditional confines of knowledge representation in Artificial Intelligence, were talking about `knowledge servers,' `semantic engines,' `ontology management systems,' and other approaches to ubiquitous knowledge before the web even came into being. However, with the expanding impact of Berners-Lee's World Wide Web, the deployment vehicle for this ubiquitous knowledge became clear, and these Artificial Intelligence technologies, brought to the web, now provide the knowledge technologies capable of powering the Semantic Web. The power of the semantic web, therefore, comes from the coupling of the knowledge technologies developed by the AI world with the power grid being developed by the Web developers. Sitting on top of web-embedded languages like the Resource Description Framework (RDF) and the Extensible Markup Language (XML), the new Semantic Web languages bring powerful AI concepts into contact with the Web infrastructure that has changed the world. The Web, reaching into virtually every computer around the world, can now carry the knowledge of the AI community with it! It is now becoming clear that the most important work making the transition from the AI labs to the standards of the World Wide Web is in the area of web ontologies. In the mid to late 1990s, several important projects showed the utility of tying machine-readable ontologies to resources on the web. These projects led to significant government interest in the area, and under the aegis of funding from the US DARPA and the EU's IST program, the Semantic Web began to grow -- gaining in size, capability and interest by leaps and bounds. Mechanisms for embedding knowledge in the web are now being standardized, and industry is beginning to take significant notice of this emerging trend. As the CTO for software of a large multi-national corporation, Richard Hayes-Roth of Hewlett-Packard, put it `we expect the Semantic Web to be as big a revolution as the original Web itself.' (Business Week, February 2002). Comprised of many of the top European researchers working in the Ontology area, the On-To-Knowledge project, from where much of the work described in this book originates, is a major contributor to this coming revolution. The book sets out new approaches to the development and deployment of knowledge on the web, and sets a precedent for high quality research in this exciting new area. This collection thus portrays state-of-the-art work demonstrating the power of new approaches to online knowledge management. In short, we nowsee the day when the careful encapsulation of knowledge into domain-specific applications is replaced by a ubiquity of knowledge sources linked together into a large, distributed web of knowledge. Databases, web services, and documents on the web will all be able to bring this power to bear -- withmachine-readable ontologies helping to power a newwave of applications. The projects described in this book are the harbingers of this coming revolution, the leading edge of this new version of the `knowledge is power' revolution.},

The framework allows us to both analyze and quantitatively simulate the behavior of single or multi-agent sys- tems with respect to interesting characteristics of the computational task environments of which they are part. We believe that it provides the correct level of abstraction for meaningfully evaluating centralized, parallel, and distributed control algorithms, ne- gotiation strategies, and organizational designs. No previous characterization formally captures the range of features, processes, and especially interrelationships that occur in computationally intensive task environments. T\AE MS exists as both a language for stating general hypotheses or theories and as a system for simulation. The simulator supports the graphical display of generated task structures, agent actions, and statistical data collection in CLOS (the Common Lisp Object System) on the TI Explorer Lisp machine and DEC Alpha.},

  abstract = {Increasing popularity of serious games draws many game designers' attention and encourages developers to involve with the field of education. In this respect, an effective serious game design becomes prominent to attain a place in the domain. That is, a successful serious game design should attach importance to educational constituents as well as game design components. On the other hand, merely adding a limited number of game elements into an educational simulation could not lead to a successful serious game. In consideration of related literature, there is an evident need for a comprehensive serious game design methodology, which place equal emphasis on both educational and game design components. In this regard, this thesis aims to propose an ontology-based methodology to design a serious game. In accordance with this purpose, Serious Game Design Ontology (SGDO), specific domain ontology, is proposed to develop serious games of various genres. Additionally, in scope of this thesis, the developed ontology was used in development process of a teacher education serious game called as Game Based Teacher Education System (GATES). In order for developing the SGDO, a variety of educational and instructional theories were surveyed and Gagne's nine events of instructional considered appropriate by reason of its compatibility with video games' v elements. This theory, in addition with main and essential elements of video games composes the concepts of SGDO. Unified Modeling Language (UML) was chosen as the ontology development language. Subsequently, the developed ontology was used in a Game Based Teacher Education System (GATES). For this purpose, the most important constituents about teacher education such as Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) and classroom management methods were added up to SGDO.},

These topics are traditionally taught in disparate courses, making it hard for data science or computer science students, or professionals, to efficiently learn the mathematics. This self-contained textbook bridges the gap between mathematical and machine learning texts, introducing the mathematical concepts with a minimum of prerequisites. It uses these concepts to derive four central machine learning methods: linear regression, principal component analysis, Gaussian mixture models, and support vector machines. For students and others with a mathematical background, these derivations provide a starting point to machine learning texts. For those learning the mathematics for the first time, the methods help build intuition and practical experience with applying mathematical concepts"--},

Although various authors have proposed partial classification systems in this field, very little has so far been published on serious game taxonomies which serve to classify any type of serious game. This article proposes a comprehensive serious game taxonomy. The aim of this taxonomy is to gather the particular features of video game design and development, the platforms used to run the games, and operational aspects such as use, users, and distribution by highlighting the idiosyncrasies of the serious component. To this end, 16 criteria are discussed in this work. The taxonomy collects a large number of features that will be useful for those looking for a serious game (e.g., to teach a subject or train a skill). If they wish to use an existing game, the taxonomy helps to choose between the different options. If they need to develop a custom game, the taxonomy details the design alternatives to consider. The proposal has been applied on 22 serious games, and some interesting conclusions are drawn from this study. In addition, a web application has been built to support the proposal.},

  abstract = {There has been growing interest on agents that represent people's interests or act on their behalf such as automated negotiators, self-driving cars, or drones. Even though people will interact often with others via these agent representatives, little is known about whether people's behavior changes when acting through these agents, when compared to direct interaction with others. Here we show that people's decisions will change in important ways because of these agents; specifically, we showed that interacting via agents is likely to lead people to behave more fairly, when compared to direct interaction with others. We argue this occurs because programming an agent leads people to adopt a broader perspective, consider the other side's position, and rely on social norms---such as fairness---to guide their decision making. To support this argument, we present four experiments: in Experiment 1 we show that people made fairer offers in the ultimatum and impunity games when interacting via agent representatives, when compared to direct interaction; in Experiment 2, participants were less likely to accept unfair offers in these games when agent representatives were involved; in Experiment 3, we show that the act of thinking about the decisions ahead of time---i.e., under the so-called ``strategy method''---can also lead to increased fairness, even when no agents are involved; and, finally, in Experiment 4 we show that participants were less likely to reach an agreement with unfair counterparts in a negotiation setting. We discuss theoretical implications for our understanding of the nature of people's social behavior with agent representatives, as well as practical implications for the design of agents that have the potential to increase fairness in society.},

While technology is evolving and new sophisticated applications are being developed, a new threat scenario is emerging in alarming proportions. Sophisticated threats with multi-vectored, multi-staged and polymorphic characteristics are performing complex attacks, making the processes of detection and mitigation far more complicated. Thus, organizations were encouraged to change their traditional defense models and to use and to develop new systems with a proactive approach. Such changes are necessary because the old approaches are not effective anymore to detect advanced attacks. Also, the organizations are encouraged to develop the ability to respond to incidents in real-time using complex threat intelligence platforms. However, since the field is growing rapidly, today Cyber Threat Intelligence concept lacks a consistent definition and a heterogeneous market has emerged, including diverse systems and tools, with different capabilities and goals. This work aims to provide a comprehensive evaluation methodology of threat intelligence standards and cyber threat intelligence platforms. The proposed methodology is based on the selection of the most relevant candidates to establish the evaluation criteria. In addition, this work studies the Cyber Threat Intelligence ecosystem and Threat Intelligence standards and platforms existing in state-of-the-art.},

Uncertainty has been studied in probability theory and graphical models, and relations have been studied in logic, in particular in the predicate calculus and its extensions. This book examines the foundations of combining logic and probability into what are called relational probabilistic models. It introduces representations, inference, and learning techniques for probability, logic, and their combinations. The book focuses on two representations in detail: Markov logic networks, a relational extension of undirected graphical models and weighted first-order predicate calculus formula, and Problog, a probabilistic extension of logic programs that can also be viewed as a Turing-complete relational extension of Bayesian networks.},

As a result of the student-centered learning approach gaining importance, gamification has emerged that transfer game components to subjects. Gamification in education health professions improves students' knowledge levels and clinical skills. Therefore, gamification techniques are integrated into physiotherapy education. This review aims to examine the effects of gamification techniques in physiotherapy and rehabilitation education. Summary\enspace{} Educational escape rooms reinforce academic achievement by enabling students to use their problemsolving skills in subjects; it provides the evaluation of practical skills by reducing anxiety and stress levels of physiotherapy students in exams. Educational board games motivate physiotherapy students, facilitate recall of information, and increase academic achievement. Online quizzes encourage physiotherapy students to study day to day in their subjects, increasing their achievement and participation in subjects. Gamified websites and gamified physiotherapy case studies motivate students, while virtual reality-based games used in practice subjects facilitate the learning process. Key messages{$\quad$} Educational escape rooms, board games, and online quizzes are commonly used within the context of gamification in physiotherapy education. With the contribution of gamification, physiotherapy students learn their subjects with fun and improve their clinical skills and academic achievement. In the future, there is a need for interventions revealing the potential and long-term effects of gamification, and comparing it with traditional education.},

  abstract = {A majority of the video game literature focuses on the negative effects of violent gaming. In addition, research tends not to analyze in-game practices of varying game genres; instead, researchers treat games as largely uniform interactive media. This study addresses gaming from multiple perspectives, including in-game prosocial actions, learning about civics, and witnessing or practicing antisocial behaviors while gaming. Using the uses and gratifications perspective and social-cognitive theories of gaming as the theoretical backbones, this study analyzed a nationally representative and convenience sample dataset using multiple regression analyses. Several genres revealed positive associations with in-game prosocial actions, learning about civics, and witnessing and/or practicing antisocial behaviors while gaming. Specifically, the role-playing genre was related to prosocial behaviors, learning about civics, and the antisocial behaviors. Similarly, the first-person shooter genre correlated significantly with each of the five dependent variables. Thus, several genres necessitate that gamers behave prosocially, antisocially, and educationally. This lends credence to the argument that games do not simply have negative effects on individuals but can simultaneously have positive effects. These results are discussed in terms of reimagining the social-cognitive theories of gaming, given that the stimulus inherent in each genre is more complicated than traditional games studies assume.

Usually summarized as "gamification", this trend connects to a sizeable body of existing concepts and research in human-computer interaction and game studies, such as serious games, pervasive games, alternate reality games, or playful design. However, it is not clear how "gamification" relates to these, whether it denotes a novel phenomenon, and how to define it. Thus, in this paper we investigate "gamification" and the historical origins of the term in relation to precursors and similar concepts. It is suggested that "gamified" applications provide insight into novel, gameful phenomena complementary to playful phenomena. Based on our research, we propose a definition of "gamification" as the use of game design elements in non-game contexts.},

Unlike recent language representation models, BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful.

  abstract = {Theory of mind refers to the ability to reason explicitly about unobservable mental content of others, such as beliefs, goals, and intentions. People often use this ability to understand the behavior of others as well as to predict future behavior. People even take this ability a step further, and use higher-order theory of mind by reasoning about the way others make use of theory of mind and in turn attribute mental states to different agents. One of the possible explanations for the emergence of the cognitively demanding ability of higher-order theory of mind suggests that it is needed to deal with mixed-motive situations. Such mixed-motive situations involve partially overlapping goals, so that both cooperation and competition play a role. In this paper, we consider a particular mixed-motive situation known as Colored Trails, in which computational agents negotiate using alternating offers with incomplete information about the preferences of their trading partner. In this setting, we determine to what extent higher-order theory of mind is beneficial to computational agents. Our results show limited effectiveness of first-order theory of mind, while second-order theory of mind turns out to benefit agents greatly by allowing them to reason about the way they can communicate their interests. Additionally, we let human participants negotiate with computational agents of different orders of theory of mind. These experiments show that people spontaneously make use of second-order theory of mind in negotiations when their trading partner is capable of second-order theory of mind as well.},

This article presents a study of the published empirical research on the application of gamification to education. The study is limited to papers that discuss explicitly the effects of using game elements in specific educational contexts. It employs a systematic mapping design. Accordingly, a categorical structure for classifying the research results is proposed based on the extracted topics discussed in the reviewed papers. The categories include gamification design principles, game mechanics, context of applying gamification (type of application, educational level, and academic subject), implementation, and evaluation. By mapping the published works to the classification criteria and analyzing them, the study highlights the directions of the currently conducted empirical research on applying gamification to education. It also indicates some major obstacles and needs, such as the need for proper technological support, for controlled studies demonstrating reliable positive or negative results of using specific game elements in particular educational contexts, etc. Although most of the reviewed papers report promising results, more substantial empirical research is needed to determine whether both extrinsic and intrinsic motivation of the learners can be influenced by gamification.},

The paper discusses the game design as resulting from co-creation and co-design experiences with each neighbourhood communities involved in initial phases. The paper argues that the local co-design activities have influenced the game definition, together with the community engagement approach. The MUV gameplay approach results thus a demand-side measure able to encouraging people to sustainable mobility modes in the awareness of their potential role as agents of urban livability. The data collected by the players will be used to support a citizen-centric approach to facilitate equity and mobility justice in urban policies.},

Both activities are fundamental in the training of philology students. In general, there are few specific electronic publishing tools for these activities, and those that exist have a professional orientation. In this article, two tools are described that have implemented the functionality necessary to carry out these activities but with an academic orientation. In this way, students can learn both activities in a friendly, intuitive environment designed for education.},

  abstract = {There is an attention shift within the gaming industry toward more natural (long-term) behavior of nonplaying characters (NPCs). Multiagent system research offers a promising technology to implement cognitive intelligent NPCs. However, the technologies used in game engines and multiagent platforms are not readily compatible due to some inherent differences of concerns. Where game engines focus on real-time aspects and thus propagate efficiency and central control, multiagent platforms assume autonomy of the agents. Increased autonomy and intelligence may offer benefits for a more compelling gameplay and may even be necessary for serious games. However, it raises problems when current game design techniques are used to incorporate state-of-the-art multiagent system technology. In this paper, we will focus on three specific problem areas that arise from this difference of view: synchronization, information representation, and communication. We argue that the current attempts for integration still fall short on some of these aspects. We show that to fully integrate intelligent agents in games, one should not only use a technical solution, but also a design methodology that is amenable to agents. The game design should be adjusted to incorporate the possibilities of agents early on in the process.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes an analysis of the evolution of approaches to knowledge management in order to identify useful patterns and perspectives for the improvement of efficiency, effectiveness, and affordable of managerial models for the economic development. The contribution offered by the literature is analyzed in the social network theory perspective and is reinterpreted in the light of the viable system approach (vSa) as a meta-model useful to highlight variables and processes involved in the interactions among several actors. The systematization of the contributions on the knowledge management facilitates the reading and the understanding of dominant managerial models, and somehow, outlines traits and characteristics of the knowledge society---as construct based on the relationship---that traditional approaches and instruments are often not properly adequate to understand. In this perspective, the paper aims to investigate the possible and potential contribution that university can offer to address the behaviors of local actors toward pathways of knowledge co-creation, able to positively impact on the local economic and social dynamics, in a win-win logic framework. Using a cross disciplinary approach, the paper proposes a conceptual framework able to identify possible influences that university can enforce on the local context in order to improve the social alignment requested to evolve from a transactional to a relational perspective, in which all actors play an active role in the processes of value generation and their needs are effectively satisfied. Proposed reflections are supported by the analysis of some practical observations with reference to the territory of Puglia region in Italy. They highlight the relevance of university as a key actor able to address the local resources to face the challenge of a changeable emerging context.},

However, gamification research has been criticized for mostly focusing on game mechanics and related outcomes while paying little attention to the psychological processes that mediate the relationship between these mechanics and outcomes. Furthermore, the majority of existing gamification studies have focused on competitive game features. Thus, the full potential of cooperative gamification has yet to be explored. Given this background, the current study compared how gamified cooperation and competition impact task effort, learning achievement, motivation and social relatedness in English vocabulary learning with a mobile application. The study utilized Social Interdependence Theory to explicate the psychological processes in gamified cooperation and competition. 75 participants were randomly assigned to either the gamified cooperation or the gamified competition condition and studied English vocabulary for 14 days. No difference was observed between the conditions regarding task effort, learning achievement and motivation. However, social relatedness in the gamified cooperation group was significantly higher than in the gamified competition group. The current findings emphasize that the positive influence of gamified cooperation on creating meaningful connections amongst learners should not be ignored, even though it facilitates similar learning and motivational outcomes as gamified competition.},

But it still faces challenges on real-time stream due to the limitation of latency and accuracy. In this paper, we propose a collaborative approach for traveltime calculation on stream of recognized data of vehicles. Compared with other types of sensory data in urban roads, the recognized data of vehicles has wider coverage, finer interval and more exact locality. Our approach continuously achieves both factual and predictive values, and consists of two-step spatio-temporal parallelism on real-time data and Bayes prior rules mining on historical data. It can be analyzed theoretically for its low latency with high accuracy, and has been implemented on Apache Storm correlated with Hadoop MapReduce. Through exhaustive experiments on simulated and real data, our approach holds millisecond-level latencies steadily on high speed stream with nearly linear scalability, and keeps the accuracy above 80\% for prediction.},

Considering real-world organizations as an analogy, this paper proposes MAS architectural patterns for information systems which adopt concepts from organizational theories. The patterns are modeled using the i* framework which offers the notions of actor, goal and actor dependency, specified in Formal Tropos and evaluated with respect to a set of software quality attributes, such as predictability or adaptability. We conduct a comparison of organizational and conventional architectures using an e-business information system case study.},

Some researchers suggest that it could also be used in web based education as a tool to increase student motivation and engagement. In an attempt to verify those theories, we have designed and built a gamification plugin for a well-known e-learning platform. We have made an experiment using this plugin in a university course, collecting quantitative and qualitative data in the process. Our findings suggest that some common beliefs about the benefits obtained when using games in education can be challenged. Students who completed the gamified experience got better scores in practical assignments and in overall score, but our findings also suggest that these students performed poorly on written assignments and participated less on class activities, although their initial motivation was higher.},

This work studies the experimental implementation of an on-demand public bus transportation service in Trikala, a medium-sized Greek city. With a view to optimize the service from both the operator's and the citizens' point of view, this paper presents an insertion heuristic solving the static multivehicle dial-a-ride problem with time windows and a fixed fleet of vehicles. Since viability of such a service depends on its ability of involving a significant number of users and getting reliable information, we tested a gamification layer, aimed at motivating public transport users to participate and behave correctly with the system. We present and discuss a novel pervasive computing architecture and various types of serious games designed to achieve these goals. We finally report early usability test results and some simulation-based indications on the design of cityscale deployable serious games to enhance public transport-based mobility.},

  abstract = {This chapter is a direct follow-up to the chapter on General Video Game Playing (GVGP). As that group recognised the need to create a Video Game Description Language (VGDL), we formed a group to address that challenge and the results of that group is the current chapter. Unlike the VGDL envisioned in the previous chapter, the language envisioned here is not meant to be supplied to the game-playing agent for automatic reasoning; instead we argue that the agent should learn this from interaction with the system. The main purpose of the language proposed here is to be able to specify complete video games, so that they could be compiled with a special VGDL compiler. Implementing such a compiler could provide numerous opportunities; users could modify existing games very quickly, or have a library of existing implementations defined within the language (e.g. an Asteroids ship or a Mario avatar) that have pre-existing, parameterised behaviours that can be customised for the users specific purposes. Provided the language is fit for purpose, automatic game creation could be explored further through experimentation with machine learning algorithms, furthering research in game creation and design. In order for both of these perceived functions to be realised and to ensure it is suitable for a large user base we recognise that the language carries several key requirements. Not only must it be human-readable, but retain the capability to be both expressive and extensible whilst equally simple as it is general. In our preliminary discussions, we sought to define the key requirements and challenges in constructing a new VGDL that will become part of the GVGP process. From this we have proposed an initial design to the semantics of the language and the components required to define a given game. Furthermore, we applied this approach to represent classic games such as Space Invaders, Lunar Lander and Frogger in an attempt to identify potential problems that may come to light. Work is ongoing to realise the potential of the VGDL for the purposes of Procedural Content Generation, Automatic Game Design and Transfer Learning.},

  abstract = {Objective: Smartphone games that aim to alter health behaviours are common, but there is uncertainty about how to achieve this. We systematically reviewed health apps containing gaming elements analysing their embedded behaviour change techniques. Methods: Two trained researchers independently coded apps for behaviour change techniques using a standard taxonomy. We explored associations with user ratings and price. Data sources: We screened the National Health Service (NHS) Health Apps Library and all top-rated medical, health and wellness and health and fitness apps (defined by Apple and Google Play stores based on revenue and downloads). We included free and paid English language apps using `gamification' (rewards, prizes, avatars, badges, leaderboards, competitions, levelling-up or health-related challenges). We excluded apps targeting health professionals. Results: 64 of 1680 (4\%) health apps included gamification and met inclusion criteria; only 3 of these were in the NHS Library. Behaviour change categories used were: feedback and monitoring (n=60, 94\% of apps), reward and threat (n=52, 81\%), and goals and planning (n=52, 81\%). Individual techniques were: self-monitoring of behaviour (n=55, 86\%), non-specific reward (n=49, 82\%), social support unspecified (n=48, 75\%), non-specific incentive (n=49, 82\%) and focus on past success (n=47, 73\%). Median number of techniques per app was 14 (range: 5--22). Common combinations were: goal setting, self-monitoring, nonspecific reward and non-specific incentive (n=35, 55\%); goal setting, self-monitoring and focus on past success (n=33, 52\%). There was no correlation between number of techniques and user ratings ( p=0.07; rs=0.23) or price ( p=0.45; rs=0.10). Conclusions: Few health apps currently employ gamification and there is a wide variation in the use of behaviour change techniques, which may limit potential to improve health outcomes. We found no correlation between user rating (a possible proxy for health benefits) and game content or price. Further research is required to evaluate effective behaviour change techniques and to assess clinical outcomes. Trial registration number: CRD42015029841.},

  abstract = {Graphs are widely used to represent structural information in the form of objects and connections between them. Graph transformation is the rule-based manipulation of graphs, an increasingly important concept in computer science and related fields. This is the first textbook treatment of the algebraic approach to graph transformation, based on algebraic structures and category theory. Part I is an introduction to the classical case of graph and typed graph transformation. In Part II basic and advanced results are first shown for an abstract form of replacement systems, so-called adhesive high-level replacement systems based on category theory, and are then instantiated to several forms of graph and Petri net transformation systems. Part III develops typed attributed graph transformation, a technique of key relevance in the modeling of visual languages and in model transformation. Part IV contains a practical case study on model transformation and a presentation of the AGG (attributed graph grammar) tool environment. Finally the appendix covers the basics of category theory, signatures and algebras. The book addresses both research scientists and graduate students in computer science, mathematics and engineering.},

  abstract = {If you're enrolled in an executive education or MBA program, you've probably encountered a powerful learning tool: the business case. But if you're like many people, you may find interpreting and writing about cases mystifying, challenging, or downright frustrating.That's not surprising: cases are not expository writing and good ones are often nonlinear and even misleading in their presentation and organization. Apply the conventional approach to understanding business cases, and you may waste time (at best) and arrive at faulty understandings (at worst). In The Case Study Handbook, William Ellet presents a potent new approach for analyzing, discussing, and writing about cases. Early chapters show how to classify cases according to the analytical task they require (solving a problem, making a decision, or forming an evaluation) and quickly establish a base of knowledge about a case. Strategies and templates, in addition to several sample Harvard Business School cases, help you apply the author's framework.Later in the book, Ellet shows how to write persuasive case-analytical essays based on the process laid out earlier. Extensive examples of effective and ineffective writing further reinforce your learning. The book also includes a chapter on how to talk about cases more effectively in class. The Case Study Handbook will be an indispensable learning aid for any current or prospective MBA or executive education student.--},

  abstract = {In this paper, dynamic meta modeling is proposed as a new approach to the operational semantics of behavioral UML diagrams. The dynamic meta model extends the well-known static meta model by a speci.cation of the system's dynamics by means of collaboration diagrams. In this way, it is possible to de.ne the behavior of UML diagrams within UML. The conceptual idea is inherited from Plotkin's structured operational semantics (SOS) paradigm, a style of semantics speci.cation for concurrent programming languages and process calculi: Collaboration diagrams are used as deduction rules to specify a goal-oriented interpreter for the language. The approach is exemplified using a fragment of UML statechart and object diagrams. Formally, collaboration diagrams are interpreted as graph transformation rules. In this way, dynamic UML semantics can be both mathematically rigorous so as to enable formal specifications and proofs and, due to the use of UML notation, understandable without prior knowledge of heavy mathematic machinery. Thus, it can be used as a reference by tool developers, teachers, and advanced users.},

The presented model was born from observations among game-playing children and their non-player parents, which directed us to have a closer look at the complex nature of gameplay experience. Our research led into a heuristic gameplay experience model that identifies some of the key components and processes that are relevant in the experience of gameplay, with a particular focus on immersion. The model includes three components: sensory, challenge-based and imaginative immersion (SCI-model). The classification was assessed with self-evaluation questionnaires filled in by informants who played different popular games. It was found that the gameplay experiences related to these games did indeed differ as expected in terms of the identified three immersion components},

  abstract = {In recent years, there has been a notable increase in the utilization of gamification for online training. Following the ``one-fits-all'' approach to designing a gamification experience for all participating users can be a significant disadvantage as all users are given the same experience. Previous approaches commonly used the static player profile that was obtained at the very beginning or initial stage of the user experience and presented the user with the gamification experience according to the fixed player type. This motivates the need for an adaptive gamification environment in online training. A dynamic adaptive gamification framework is proposed to introduce a gamification framework consisting of a method to correlate player types and game elements. The correlation is aimed at identifying the evolvement of players through interaction with game elements and observing how these player profiles are motivated to change over time. The study also presents an evaluation method to measure motivation in adoption and engagement in online training to reduce boredom and improve the overall user experience of the player.},

While such solutions offer personalised data and suggestions, the real disruptive step comes from the interaction of new digital ecosystem, represented by chatbots. Chatbots will play a leading role by embodying the function of a virtual assistant and bridging the gap between patients and clinicians. Powered by AI and machine learning algorithms, chatbots are forecasted to save healthcare costs when used in place of a human or assist them as a preliminary step of helping to assess a condition and providing self-care recommendations. This paper describes integrating chatbots into telemedicine systems intended for elderly patient after their hospital discharge.

  abstract = {This paper introduces a real-time 3D reconstruction of a human captured using a depth sensor and has integrated it with a holographic telepresence application. Holographic projection is widely recognized as one of the most promising 3D display technologies, and it is expected to become more widely available in the near future. This technology may also be deployed in various ways, including holographic prisms and Z-Hologram, which this research has used to demonstrate the initial results by displaying the reconstructed 3D representation of the user. The realization of a stable and inexpensive 3D data acquisition system is a problem that has yet to be solved. When we involve multiple sensors we need to compress and optimize the data so that it can be sent to a server for a telepresence. Therefore the paper presents the processes in real-time 3D reconstruction, which consists of data acquisition, background removal, point cloud extraction, and a surface generation which applies a marching cube algorithm to finally form an isosurface from the set of points in the point cloud which later texture mapping is applied on the isosurface generated. The compression results has been presented in this paper, and the results of the integration process after sending the data over the network also have been discussed.},

Reasoning About Knowledge is the first book to provide a general discussion of approaches to reasoning about knowledge and its applications to distributed systems, artificial intelligence, and game theory. It brings eight years of work by the authors into a cohesive framework for understanding and analyzing reasoning about knowledge that is intuitive, mathematically well founded, useful in practice, and widely applicable.

  abstract = {Ontologies are increasingly recognized as essential components in many fields of information science. Ontologies were first employed in artificial intelligence, as a means to conceptualize some part of the real world. The first aim was to enable software system to reason about real-world entities. The CyC ontology (Lenat 1995) is typical of this perspective, it is comprised of several thousand concepts and tens of thousand facts, expressed as logical formulae. A second aim of ontologies was to provide a common conceptualization of a domain on which different agents agree. It is certainly this aspect of ontologies that triggered widespread interest in this knowledge engineering artifact in fields such as information system design, system integration and interoperation, natural language processing, or information retrieval. For instance, the Gene ontology (The Gene Ontology Consortium 2001) provides a common vocabulary to standardize the representation of gene and gene products. Although the concept of ontology is now well understood and equipped with an array of theoretical and practical tools (there are currently several dozens of books on ontology engineering), the practical implementation of ontologies in a specific applicative context remains a challenging task. Moreover, the effectiveness or cost-benefit evaluation of ontology-based approaches still requires more research. One of the purposes of this book is to explore these questions in the urban domain.},

  abstract = {In recent years, online social networking has revolutionized interpersonal communication. The newer research on language analysis in social media has been increasingly focusing on the latter's impact on our daily lives, both on a personal and a professional level. Natural language processing (NLP) is one of the most promising avenues for social media data processing. It is a scientific challenge to develop powerful methods and algorithms which extract relevant information from a large volume of data coming from multiple sources and languages in various formats or in free form. We discuss the challenges in analyzing social media texts in contrast with traditional documents. Research methods in information extraction, automatic categorization and clustering, automatic summarization and indexing, and statistical machine translation need to be adapted to a new kind of data. This book reviews the current research on NLP tools and methods for processing the non-traditional information from social media data that is available in large amounts (big data), and shows how innovative NLP approaches can integrate appropriate linguistic information in various fields such as social media monitoring, healthcare, business intelligence, industry, marketing, and security and defence. We review the existing evaluation metrics for NLP and social media applications, and the new efforts in evaluation campaigns or shared tasks on new datasets collected from social media. Such tasks are organized by the Association for Computational Linguistics (such as SemEval tasks) or by the National Institute of Standards and Technology via the Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) and the Text Analysis Conference (TAC). In the concluding chapter, we discuss the importance of this dynamic discipline and its great potential for NLP in the coming decade, in the context of changes in mobile technology, cloud computing, virtual reality, and social networking. In this second edition, we have added information about recent progress in the tasks and applications presented in the first edition. We discuss new methods and their results. The number of research projects and publications that use social media data is constantly increasing due to continuously growing amounts of social media data and the need to automatically process them. We have added 85 new references to the more than 300 references from the first edition. Besides updating each section, we have added a new application (digital marketing) to the section on media monitoring and we have augmented the section on healthcare applications with an extended discussion of recent research on detecting signs of mental illness from social media.},

  abstract = {The optimal coalition structure determination problem is in general computationally hard. In this article, we identify some problem instances for which the space of possible coalition structures has a certain form and constructively prove that the problem is polynomial time solvable. Specifically, we consider games with an ordering over the players and introduce a distance metric for measuring the distance between any two structures. In terms of this metric, we define the property of monotonicity, meaning that coalition structures closer to the optimal, as measured by the metric, have higher value than those further away. Similarly, quasi-monotonicity means that part of the space of coalition structures is monotonic, while part of it is non-monotonic. (Quasi)-monotonicity is a property that can be satisfied by coalition games in characteristic function form and also those in partition function form. For a setting with a monotonic value function and a known player ordering, we prove that the optimal coalition structure determination problem is polynomial time solvable and devise such an algorithm using a greedy approach. We extend this algorithm to quasi-monotonic value functions and demonstrate how its time complexity improves from exponential to polynomial as the degree of monotonicity of the value function increases. We go further and consider a setting in which the value function is monotonic and an ordering over the players is known to exist but ordering itself is unknown. For this setting too, we prove that the coalition structure determination problem is polynomial time solvable and devise such an algorithm.},

Instructor's key role is to persuade our students to do this and thus to motivate them. In the past, our students identified programming as a vital skill in demand by industry. Consequently they were motivated to acquire a useful skill that would be relevant in some future job or lucrative career. Nowadays, our WEB age students have no idea why they have to study programming. Programming courses are seen simply as mandatory parts of the degree course to be negotiated. Their world of computing is multithreaded computer programs with impressive human interfaces for games and WEB. They cannot relate them with the classical programming exercises that ask for single-threaded programs performing a sequence of calculations. Given this, we decided to introduce our students in problem solving using what they view as real-world problems such as games and WEB-programming.},

With the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and the ability of AI systems to make automated and self-learned decisions, a call for transparency of how such systems reach decisions has echoed within academic and policy circles. The term transparency, however, relates to multiple concepts, fulfills many functions, and holds different promises that struggle to be realized in concrete applications. Indeed, the complexity of transparency for ADM shows tension between transparency as a normative ideal and its translation to practical application. To address this tension, we first conduct a review of transparency, analyzing its challenges and limitations concerning automated decision-making practices. We then look at the lessons learned from the development of Privacy by Design, as a basis for developing the Transparency by Design principles. Finally, we propose a set of nine principles to cover relevant contextual, technical, informational, and stakeholder-sensitive considerations. Transparency by Design is a model that helps organizations design transparent AI systems, by integrating these principles in a step-by-step manner and as an ex-ante value, not as an afterthought.},

  abstract = {In recent years, gamification mechanics have been extensively adopted by crowdsourcing platforms to improve solvers' participation and user experience. However, although gamified crowdsourcing on competitive platforms has frequently been investigated, gamified collaborative crowdsourcing platforms are poorly understood, especially platforms where solvers cooperatively contribute knowledge. It remains unclear how solvers' intrinsic and extrinsic motivations mediate the relationship between gamification mechanics and solvers' knowledge contribution. Based on self-determination theory and related literature, this study theorises the mediating roles of three intrinsic motivations (self-esteem, competence enhancement, and a sense of virtual community) and extrinsic motivations in the relationship between three typical gamification mechanics (immersion, social, and achievement) and solvers' knowledge contribution. It then tests the hypotheses using survey data from 386 solvers from a large collaborative knowledge crowdsourcing platform. The empirical results show that self-esteem and competence enhancement positively mediate the impact of gamification mechanics on knowledge contribution, whereas extrinsic motivation negatively mediates this impact. The theoretical contributions and practical implications of this study are discussed.},

To resolve these difficulties we claim that organization centered multi-agent system, or OCMAS for short, may be used. We propose a set of general principles from which true OCMAS may be designed. One of these principles is not to as- sume anything about the cognitive capabilities of agents. In order to show how OCMAS models may be designed, we propose a very concise and mini- mal OCMAS model called AGR, for Agent/Group/Role. We propose a set of notations and a methodological framework to help the designer to build MAS using AGR. We then show that it is possible to design multi-agent systems using only OCMAS models.},

Conversational agents may offer a convenient, engaging way of getting support at any time. Objective: The objective of the study was to determine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a fully automated conversational agent to deliver a self-help program for college students who self-identify as having symptoms of anxiety and depression. Methods: In an unblinded trial, 70 individuals age 18-28 years were recruited online from a university community social media site and were randomized to receive either 2 weeks (up to 20 sessions) of self-help content derived from CBT principles in a conversational format with a text-based conversational agent (Woebot) (n=34) or were directed to the National Institute of Mental Health ebook, ``Depression in College Students,'' as an information-only control group (n=36). All participants completed Web-based versions of the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), and the Positive and Negative Affect Scale at baseline and 2-3 weeks later (T2). Results: Participants were on average 22.2 years old (SD 2.33), 67\% female (47/70), mostly non-Hispanic (93\%, 54/58), and Caucasian (79\%, 46/58). Participants in the Woebot group engaged with the conversational agent an average of 12.14 (SD 2.23) times over the study period. No significant differences existed between the groups at baseline, and 83\% (58/70) of participants provided data at T2 (17\% attrition). Intent-to-treat univariate analysis of covariance revealed a significant group difference on depression such that those in the Woebot group significantly reduced their symptoms of depression over the study period as measured by the PHQ-9 (F=6.47; P=.01) while those in the information control group did not. In an analysis of completers, participants in both groups significantly reduced anxiety as measured by the GAD-7 (F1,54= 9.24; P=.004). Participants' comments suggest that process factors were more influential on their acceptability of the program than content factors mirroring traditional therapy. Conclusions: Conversational agents appear to be a feasible, engaging, and effective way to deliver CBT. (JMIR Ment Health 2017;4(2):e19) doi: 10.2196/mental.7785},

  abstract = {Introduction: Telemedicine has emerged as a critical technology to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 infection. We aim in this work to explore how general practitioners (GPs) perceived the use of telemedicine, recently recognized and reimbursed by the Public Health Insurance House (PHIH) for primary care (PC) provision. Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed in 2020 in one county of Romania using an anonymous questionnaire that assessed physicians' perceptions regarding teleconsultation, reliability in tele-decision, remote pathology management, pregnant women's surveillance, patients' satisfaction with telemedicine, the need for its further reimbursement. Bivariate correlation was used to measure associations between the investigated issues. Results: More than a quarter of GPs (28.6\%) found it easier to address patients' healthcare needs remotely, while 60.7\% considered time-consuming teleconsultations compared to faceto-face visits. Tele-diagnostic uncertainty was expressed by 64.3\% of physicians, and a quarter were confident in tele-decisions. Almost half of GPs (43\%) observed patients' satisfaction with tele-visits, while half said patients encountered difficulties using technology. A large percentage of doctors (62.5\%) perceived that patients felt as well treated by virtual as in-person visit and 91.1\% suggested post-pandemic reimbursement. The results of the bivariate correlation showed that physicians who perceived positive patient feedback on telemedicine were more supportive of subsequent reimbursement. Conclusion: This study showed the GPs' positive perception of the use of telemedicine. Its adoption in PC has shed light on the shadows of the pandemic. The time-consuming nature of teleconsultations, uncertainty in tele-decisions, patients' difficulties in using technology were seen as shadows of telecare. However, most of the GPs surveyed agreed with the need for further reimbursement. Future work should focus on innovative solutions for integrating telemedicine as complementary form of PC, the need for telemedicine-based training for GPs to improve capacity building, and patients' perceptions of virtual care, helping to build trust and satisfaction.},

Integrating social networks in Tunisian medical tourism recommender systems can result in much more accurate rec- ommendations. That is to say, information, interests, and recommendations re- trieved from social networks can improve the prediction accuracy. This paper aims to improve traditional recommender systems by incorporating information in social network; including user preferences and influences from social friends. Accordingly, a user interest ontology is developed to make personalized recommendations out of such information. In this paper, we present a semantic social recommender system employing a user interest ontology and a Tunisian Medical Tourism ontology. Our system can improve the quality of recommen- dation for Tunisian tourism domain. Finally, our social recommendation algo- rithm is implemented in order to be used in a Tunisia tourism Website to assist users interested in visiting Tunisia for medical purposes.},

Through an analysis of qualitative interviews, the goal of this study is to draw from the concepts of hybrid space, spatial legibility, and gamification to show how Foursquare's gaming elements can add a playful layer to physical spaces and discuss the impacts of the application designers' goal of turning ``life into a game.''},

Because transportation is inherently a mobile activity, mobile devices are well suited to sense and provide feedback about these activities. In this paper, we explore the use of personal ambient displays on mobile phones to give users feedback about sensed and self-reported transportation behaviors. We first present results from a set of formative studies exploring our respondents' existing transportation routines, willingness to engage in and maintain green transportation behavior, and reactions to early mobile phone ``green'' application design concepts. We then describe the results of a 3-week field study (N=13) of the UbiGreen Transportation Display prototype, a mobile phone application that semi-automatically senses and reveals information about transportation behavior. Our contributions include a working system for semiautomatically tracking transit activity, a visual design capable of engaging users in the goal of increasing green transportation, and the results of our studies, which have implications for the design of future green applications.},

  abstract = {A temporal database environment, particularly if equipped with a log of the execution of predefined application-domain operations, can be regarded as a repository of narratives concerning the activities observed in the mini-world of interest. The analysis of these narratives leads to the construction of a library of typical plans, which can be used by Plan-recognition / Plan-generation algorithms to help prediction, decision-making and the adoption of corrective measures with respect to ongoing activities. The formulation of concepts and methods for identifying the typical plans, and, more generally, for discovering meaningful narrative patterns, should be based on Cognitive Science and, especially, on the various contributions of Literary Theories to the interpretation of narratives. The proposed goal- oriented approach emerges as a promising research line to help understanding, and hence better modelling and using, in their many dimensions, today's computer-based information systems.},

  abstract = {Ferguson's (2015a) meta-analysis assessed a very important and controversial topic about children's mental health and video games. In response to the concerns raised by researchers about the appropriateness of the meta-analytical methods used by Ferguson; we decided to reanalyze the data and discuss two major misconceptions about meta-analysis. We argue that partial correlations can (and should) be meta-analyzed instead of zero-order bivariate correlations if the predictors included in the partial correlation represent a similar construct. We also discuss the fallacy by which the conventional meta-analytical model assumes that the studies' effect sizes came into being according to the same random effect construct used by the analysis. Our replication results using partial correlations, standardized (valid and reliable) outcomes, and an improved meta-analytical model (that does not assume a random effect is the mechanism of data generation) confirmed the main results of Ferguson's meta-analysis. There was a significant yet very small effect on aggressive behavior of exposure to both general, r               p               = 0.062, 95\% CI [0.012, 0.112], and violent, r               p               = 0.055, 95\% CI [0.019, 0.091], video games. A very small effect was seen on reduced prosocial behavior, but this was only in the general video game exposure category, r               p               = 0.072, 95\% CI [0.045, 0.100].},

Although building on decades of previous work in the field, it is the first collection to take into account the significant changes in the landscape of deontic logic that have occurred in the past twenty years. These changes have resulted largely, though not entirely, from the interaction of deontic logic with a variety of other fields, including computer science, legal theory, organizational theory, economics, and linguistics. This first volume of the Handbook is divided into three parts, containing nine chapters in all, each written by leading experts in the field. The first part concentrates on historical foundations. The second examines topics of central interest in contemporary deontic logic. The third presents some new logical frameworks that have now become part of the mainstream literature.},

  abstract = {The increasing mobility of Internet users and the growing need to collaborate with staff travelling on business belong to the key characteristics of the future Internet. Mobile collaborative applications require novel schemes for group communication that actively support collaborations in wireless scenarios. An intrinsic problem of collaborations in wireless scenarios is the temporary connection loss with the group due to user mobility and network issues. Existing group communication protocols do not sufficiently support this situation. In this paper, we present a new peer-to-peer group communication protocol, called Moversight, that was specifically designed to support closed group cooperation in mobile environments with varying churn rates. It applies a new group communication paradigm, called mobile optimistic virtual synchrony, to handle churn-related peer failures. It enhances the virtual synchrony paradigm for mobile scenarios. The paper introduces the paradigm and describes the main protocol features of Moversight. Finally we present simulation results to demonstrate the applicability of the protocol.},

  abstract = {Electricity markets worldwide are complex and dynamic environments with very particular characteristics, resulting from their restructuring and evolution into regional and continental scales, along with the constant changes brought by the increasing necessity for an adequate integration of renewable energy sources. The rising complexity and unpredictability in electricity markets has increased the need for the intervenient entities in foreseeing market behaviour. Several modelling tools directed to the study of restructured wholesale electricity markets have emerged. However, they have a common limitation: the lack of interoperability between the various systems to allow the exchange of information and knowledge, to test different market models and to allow market players from different systems to interact in common market environments. This paper proposes the Electricity Markets Ontology, which integrates the essential necessary concepts related with electricity markets, while enabling an easier cooperation and adequate communication between related systems. Additionally, it can be extended and complemented according to the needs of other simulators and real systems in this area.},

  abstract = {This paper deals with the modalities of the Smart Automated Health Machine (AHM) using Internet of Things (IoT), a user-friendly health machine with an interactive graphical user interface for medical necessities. It is a virtual health check-up/self-screening/test system, aimed at being the first point of contact for patient screening, to monitor heart rate, blood pressure, ECG, oxygen saturation, and visual acuity of patients. In case of emergency, a doctor will be available online through a video call, based on the severity of patients' conditions, a call can be placed by a doctor to book an ambulance van or ambulance bike (based on the conditions). If a patient is unconscious, a direct call can be placed by any bystander or patient's carer to book an ambulance. In non-emergency cases, medical appointments can be booked - the system will also dispense medicines based on the health conditions and/or doctor's electronic prescription which can be selected among the list of available medicines. Each individual will be provided with a "smart health card", which will keep a record of patients' personal details, health conditions, prescriptions, and amount of tablets consumed. The AHM will provide all the necessary information, keep a record of different medical problems in different regions and different necessities required to be adopted. The system can also be called as "Self Healthcare Service (SHS)" or "Self Healthcare Units (SHU)" -the initiatives are part of sustainable development goals (SDG-3) proposed by United Nations.We conducted a pilot evaluation with the patients, nurses and doctors. As an overall outcome, the practitioners feel the system can be adopted in an area where medical facility is not available immediately. Adopting this system in such regions not only help in medical emergencies/epidemic/pandemic such as COVID, it also increases the percentage of survival. The system can also be adopted in hospitals, pharmacies, schools, public places like bus/train stations, airports, markets or any commercial areas, zones prone to accidents in rural and urban areas and other places that can be quite useful and helpful to the public.},

  abstract = {We study a fair resource sharing problem, where a set of resources are to be shared among a group of agents. Each agent demands one resource and each resource can serve a limited number of agents. An agent cares about what resource they get as well as the externalities imposed by their mates, who share the same resource with them. Clearly, the strong notion of envy-freeness, where no agent envies another for their resource or mates, cannot always be achieved and we show that even deciding the existence of such a strongly envy-free assignment is an intractable problem. Hence, a more interesting question is whether (and in what situations) a relaxed notion of envy-freeness, the Pareto envyfreeness, can be achieved. Under this relaxed notion, an agent envies another only when they envy both the resource and the mates of the other agent. In particular, we are interested in a dorm assignment problem, where students are to be assigned to dorms with the same capacity and they have dichotomous preference over their dormmates. We show that when the capacity of each dorm is 2, a Pareto envy-free assignment always exists and we present a polynomial-time algorithm to compute such an assignment. Nevertheless, the result breaks immediately when the capacity increases to 3, in which case even Pareto envyfreeness cannot be guaranteed. In addition to the existential results, we also investigate the utility guarantees of (Pareto) envy-free assignments in our model.},

The development of AmI is a very complex task because this technology must often adapt to contextual information as well as unpredictable behaviours and environmental features. The architecture presented deals with AmI applications in order to cover the different components of these kinds of systems: environment, users, context and adaptation. This architecture is the first one that is able to cover all these features, which are needed in a full AmI system. The paper shows that AmISim is able to cover a complete AmI system and to provide a framework which can test scenarios that would be impossible to test in real environments or even with previous simulation approaches. Simulated and real elements coexist in AmISim for a robust testing, validation and verification of the AmI systems, which provide an easier and less costly deployment.},

  abstract = {Organizations have become the backbone of the society. Humans live around all kinds of organizations, such as neighborhood communities, businesses, schools, unions, political, sports, and religious organizations, etc. These organizations have a set of members, each playing a specific role, which determines their duties and functionalities within the organization. One of these functionalities is to offer a range of services to members of the organization and external people. These mem- bersmust follow a set of norms to ensure the proper functioning of the organization and should pursue the global goals of the organization. A feature that is repeated in organizations is that they are not static but dynamic, resulting in changes in both its structure and the way in which they behave. In an organization, any of its elements is prone to change due to situations that occur in the organization itself or its environment. Researchers in the field of social sciences and organizations have studied such situations, the reasons why they appear and solutions and actions to be taken to ensure that this situation does not damage the organization or to take advantage of the situation. These situations are known as `Forces that drive organizational change'. Human organizations are the main source of inspiration for the Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) based on organizations. These systems are computational ab- stractions that are populated by agents instead of people, but take into account organizational elements such as roles, services, goals, norms, etc. However, the proposals that have been presented up to now to define this type of MAS are fo- cused mostly on static systems, without changes in its structure. Moreover, in the few proposals that take into account organizational changes, they just state that changes occur, but without specifying the reason for change. Thus, the concept of `forces that drive organizational change' (and their features) is not considered. Therefore, the objective of this PhD thesis is to translate the knowledge of the forces that drive organizational change available in human organizations to MAS- based organizations. These forces will be formally expressed with the factors that help to detect them. The solutions to be taken when a force is detected will also be presented. To correctly perform this task, a formalization for virtual organi- zations is designed, named Virtual Organization Formalization (VOF). Moreover, the Artifacts for Organizational Mechanisms are proposed, which are a tool to help in the representation of organizational knowledge and in the modeling of the environment of the organization. This tool is based on the Agents \& Artifacts (A\&A) framework.},

  abstract = {The aim of this paper is to illustrate and sensitize reader to the variety of perspectives and the fundamental nature of organizations as stable/stabilizing systems and as multi-perspective action systems. Researchers have been explicitly thinking about MAS/DAI organizations and attempting to link formal (human) organization theory with MAS/DAI models for at least twenty years. Despite this, the idea of organizations has been a peripheral theme in MAS/DAI research---primarily a specific coordination technique---not really one of the central intellectual issues of the field. The theory of `natural' organizations has a somewhat longer, more diverse, and more thorough intellectual history than that of organizations in MAS. Beyond recent work in human social and organization theory, some newer research on abstract organizations has been attempting to unify concepts in biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics, and computing theory (e.g., the lambda calculus), with those of natural social organizations and multi-agent systems. The landscape for thinking about organizations in MAS is growing quite interesting, and this paper surveys this landscape. It presents and contrasts some conceptions of organization that have emerged and proven useful, and attempts to show how these have been implemented, experimented with, and applied. It also projects some future directions for research on MAS organizations, and gives some thoughts on where the most exciting issues lie.},

  abstract = {Decentralized paradigm in the field of cybersecurity and machine learning (ML) for the emerging Internet of Things (IoT) has gained a lot of attention from the government, academia, and industries in recent years. Federated cybersecurity (FC) is regarded as a revolutionary concept to make the IoT safer and more efficient in the future. This emerging concept has the potential of detecting security threats, taking countermeasures, and limiting the spreading of threats over the IoT network system efficiently. An objective of cybersecurity is achieved by forming the federation of the learned and shared model on top of various participants. Federated learning (FL), which is regarded as a privacy-aware ML model, is particularly useful to secure the vulnerable IoT environment. In this article, we start with background and comparison of centralized learning, distributed on-site learning, and FL, which is then followed by a survey of the application of FL to cybersecurity for IoT. This survey primarily focuses on the security aspect but it also discusses several approaches that address the performance issues (e.g., accuracy, latency, resource constraint, and others) associated with FL, which may impact the security and overall performance of the IoT. To anticipate the future evolution of this new paradigm, we discuss the main ongoing research efforts, challenges, and research trends in this area. With this article, readers can have a more thorough understanding of FL for cybersecurity as well as cybersecurity for FL, different security attacks, and countermeasures.},

Tese systems are governed by policies in a multi-scale institutional context. While policy is a top-down instrument, its effect is determined by a bottom-up process, in the sense that the aggregate be- havior of the social system is the result of interaction and reasoning on the level of individuals. We argue that understanding social systems at the individual level significantly contributes to understanding and predicting the effectiveness of pol- icies. Given that agent-based modeling (ABM) allows for rich representation of individuals, it is well suited for providing necessary insights for policy analysis. To support this claim, in this paper, we give a systematic overview of the re- quirements that policy analysis puts forward. By viewing policy analysis as a cycle of activities, we discuss five categories: problem definition, policy evalu- ation, identification of alternative policies, decision support, and monitoring. Moreover, we evaluate mathematical and computational tools with respect to these requirements. Finally, we propose a list of extensions to ABM for moni- toring, decision making, and participatory design in the policy analysis cycle.},

  abstract = {As machine learning is used to analyse data and produce some action based on that data, the application in the domain of cryptanalysis opens new points of view, since the key space of any complex cipher system is large. When concerning machine learning with the algorithms of cryptography, the possibility to learn from the experience that is provided by information retrieval, is being considered. With the understanding that cryptanalysis can be used for improvement and producing more complex solutions in the field of cryptography, common features are sought between these three fields. This paper aims to present the application of machine learning in the field of cryptanalysis, as a prime step for auditing and checking the strength of cryptosystems. Some of these cryptosystems ensure confidentiality and security of a variety of information exchanged from source to destination using symmetric key cryptography. Accordingly, understanding how the algorithms are maintaining the stability is the fundamental aspect for proceeding with the analysis. The experimental part of this paper provides a solution for application of neural networks in cryptanalysis. We show that AES with ECB mode is vulnerable to ciphertext-plaintext attacks. The analysis is focused on trying different sizes of keys for obtaining the ciphertexts from plaintexts. At the end, we discuss how that is impacting the difficulty of data reveal by decrypting with DNN (Artificial Neural Network).},

  abstract = {Neural networks are a family of powerful machine learning models. This book focuses on the application of neural network models to natural language data. The first half of the book (Parts I and II) covers the basics of supervised machine learning and feed-forward neural networks, the basics of working with machine learning over language data, and the use of vector-based rather than symbolic representations for words. It also covers the computation-graph abstraction, which allows to easily define and train arbitrary neural networks, and is the basis behind the design of contemporary neural network software libraries. The second part of the book (Parts III and IV) introduces more specialized neural network architectures, including 1D convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, conditioned-generation models, and attention-based models. These architectures and techniques are the driving force behind state-of-the-art algorithms for machine translation, syntactic parsing, and many other applications. Finally, we also discuss tree-shaped networks, structured prediction, and the prospects of multi-task learning.},

To capture domain knowledge of a given domain and organize it in a shared and consensuated conceptual model, we recommend an approach that integrates the following intermediate representation techniques: Data Dictionary, Concepts Classification Trees, Tables of Instance Attributes, Table of Class Attributes, Table of Constants, Tables of Formulas, Attributes Classification Trees, and Tables of Instances. We also provide a set of guidelines to verify the knowledge gathered inside each intermediate representations and between intermediate representations.},

  abstract = {Video games have assumed an important place in our daily lives. This has led to an increasing interest on the use of games for non-entertainment purposes, introducing the concept of Serious Games (SGs). In particular, SGs are being explored because of their potential to provide reliable assessments, but also because they can measure competences that would be difficult to measure using traditional forms of assessment. However, one of the key issues is that assessment machinery has to be designed specifically for each game, increasing the time and effort when designing and implementing Game-Based Assessments (GBAs). In this research, we introduce a novel approach to develop interoperable GBAs by: (1) designing and creating an ontology that can standardize the GBA area; (2) conducting a validation study on literature metrics to replicate them and designing novel metrics using data from different SGs; (3) conducting a case study that illustrates how our approach can be used in a real life scenario with real data. Our results confirm that the designed ontology can be used to effectively perform GBAs, along with the metrics replicated and designed in the system. We expect our work to solve the current limitations regarding GBA interoperability, thus allowing the deployment of Game-Based Assessments as a Service (GBAaaS).},

However, describing these limits is difficult if there is no interpretive model that explain the transition between the game and the gamification. This work proposes a systemic game--gamification model to understand the phenomenon of the gamification procedure. This structural-functionalist and systemic model can respond to different fields interested in gamification under the same elements and assume to serve as an interpretation only for this phenomenon's social reality from the complexity. Some risks of gamification are highlighted, such as isolating and considering only some elements that do not even belong to the game, as is frequently the case with the competition system, an issue that, in analogy with game-sport, becomes sportification.},

  abstract = {The industry is currently undergoing a digital revolution driven by the integration of several enabling technologies. These include automation, robotics, cloud computing, industrial cybersecurity, systems integration, digital twins, etc. Of particular note is the increasing use of digital twins, which offer significant added value by providing realistic and fully functional process simulations. This paper proposes an approach for developing digital twins in industrial environments. The novelty lies in not only focusing on obtaining the model of the industrial system and integrating virtual reality and/or augmented reality but also in emphasizing the importance of incorporating other enabled technologies of Industry 4.0, such as system integration, connectivity with standard and specific industrial protocols, cloud services, or new industrial automation systems, to enhance the capabilities of the digital twin. Furthermore, a proposal of the software tools that can be used to achieve this incorporation is made. Unity is chosen as the real-time 3D development tool for its cross-platform capability and streamlined industrial system modeling. The integration of augmented reality is facilitated by the Vuforia SDK. Node-RED is selected as the system integration option, and communications are carried out with MQTT protocol. Finally, cloud-based services are recommended for effective data storage and processing. Furthermore, this approach has been used to develop a digital twin of a robotic electro-pneumatic cell.},

  abstract = {This essay extends Simon's arguments in the Sciences of the Artificial to a critical examination of how theorizing in Information Technology disciplines should occur. The essay is framed around a number of fundamental questions that relate theorizing in the artificial sciences to the traditions of the philosophy of science. Theorizing in the artificial sciences is contrasted with theorizing in other branches of science and the applicability of the scientific method is questioned. The paper argues that theorizing should be considered in a holistic manner that links two modes of theorizing: an interior mode with the how of artifact construction studied and an exterior mode with the what of existing artifacts studied. Unlike some representations in the design science movement the paper argues that the study of artifacts once constructed can not be passed back uncritically to the methods of traditional science. Seven principles for creating knowledge in IT disciplines are derived: (i) artifact system centrality; (ii) artifact purposefulness; (iii) need for design theory; (iv) induction and abduction in theory building; (v) artifact construction as theory building; (vi) interior and exterior modes for theorizing; and (viii) issues with generality. The implicit claim is that consideration of these principles will improve knowledge creation and theorizing in design disciplines, for both design science researchers and also for researchers using more traditional methods. Further, attention to these principles should lead to the creation of more useful and relevant knowledge.},

  abstract = {Cooperation is the fundamental underpinning of multi-agent systems, allowing agents to interact to achieve their goals. Where agents are self-interested, or potentially unreliable, there must be appropriate mechanisms to cope with the uncertainty that arises. In particular, agents must manage the risk associated with interacting with others who have different objectives, or who may fail to fulfil their commitments. Previous work has utilised the notions of motivation and trust in engendering successful cooperation between self-interested agents. Motivations provide a means for representing and reasoning about agents' overall objectives, and trust offers a mechanism for modelling and reasoning about reliability, honesty, veracity and so forth. This paper extends that work to address some of its limitations. In particular, we introduce the concept of a clan: a group of agents who trust each other and have similar objectives. Clan members treat each other favourably when making private decisions about cooperation, in order to gain mutual benefit. We describe mechanisms for agents to form, maintain, and dissolve clans in accordance with their self-interested nature, along with giving details of how clan membership influences individual decision making. Finally, through some simulation experiments we illustrate the effectiveness of clan formation in addressing some of the inherent problems with cooperation among self-interested agents.},

Next, they address the problems of theory and conceptual framework for individual-based ecology: What is "theory"? That is, how do we develop reusable models of how system dynamics arise from characteristics of individuals? What conceptual framework do we use when the classical differential equation framework no longer applies? An extensive review illustrates the ecological problems that have been addressed with individual-based models. The authors then identify how the mechanics of building and using individual-based models differ from those of traditional science, and provide guidance on formulating, programming, and analyzing models. This book will be helpful to ecologists interested in modeling, and to other scientists interested in agent-based modeling.},

Key findings include the fact that contrary to what one might expect, neither presidential candidate was framed in an overly critical manner in his opponent's Facebook space nor on Twitter's dedicated nonpartisan election page. Beyond this, similarities and divergences in sentiment across social media spaces are observed that allow for a better understanding of what is being communicated in political social media.

  abstract = {In recent years, the interest in research concerning gamification in higher education has grown considerably. Although a simple search in Web of Science return more than 4000 papers on gamification, there are very few studies based on a bibliometric analysis. Therefore, a thorough evaluation of this field and its challenges is highly necessary and can help us better understand the diversity of gamification approaches, the ways in which various scholars, countries, institutions or universities reacted through research and scientific publications to the study of gamification in higher education space. Using a bibliometric approach, we analysed 1029 papers on gamification in higher education, indexed by Web of Science Core Collection, in Science Citation Index Expanded and Social Sciences Citation Index. In addition to the bibliometric indicators offered by Web of Science, we used the VosViewer software in order to visualize the intellectual structure, conceptual dynamics, diffusion of knowledge, development over time, research trends, core authors, top journals, leading countries and institutions, the impact of collaboration, etc. To achieve these goals, we set the following research objectives: establishing a descriptive structure (content analysis); determining the impact scientific publications have on generating new knowledge (citation and co-citation analysis); tracing collaboration patterns (co-authorship analysis) and identifying key research areas and emerging trends (co-occurrence analysis). The main findings increased our understanding of the use of gamification in higher education: we identified vital research, landmark studies in the development of the field, critical past contributions, emerging trends and potentially transformative ideas.},

  abstract = {To support the sharing and reuse of formally represented knowledge among AI systems, it is useful to define the common vocabulary in which shared knowledge is represented. A specification of a representational vocabulary for a shared domain of discourse --- definitions of classes, relations, functions, and other objects --- is called an ontology. This paper describes a mechanism for defining ontologies that are portable over representation systems. Definitions written in a standard format for predicate calculus are translated by a system called Ontolingua into specialized representations, including frame-based systems as well as relational languages. This allows researchers to share and reuse ontologies, while retaining the computational benefits of specialized implementations. We discuss how the translation approach to portability addresses several technical problems. One problem is how to accommodate the stylistic and organizational differences among representations while preserving declarative content. Another is how to translate from a very expressive language into restricted languages, remaining system-independent while preserving the computational efficiency of implemented systems. We describe how these problems are addressed by basing Ontolingua itself on an ontology of domain-independent, representational idioms. 1.},

AI-generated fake content, commonly called Deepfakes, have been raising new issues and concerns, but also new challenges for the research community. The Deepfake detection task has become widely addressed, but unfortunately, approaches in the literature suffer from generalization issues. In this paper, the Face Deepfake Detection and Reconstruction Challenge is described. Two different tasks were proposed to the participants: (i) creating a Deepfake detector capable of working in an ``in the wild'' scenario; (ii) creating a method capable of reconstructing original images from Deepfakes. Real images from CelebA and FFHQ and Deepfake images created by StarGAN, StarGAN-v2, StyleGAN, StyleGAN2, AttGAN and GDWCT were collected for the competition. The winning teams were chosen with respect to the highest classification accuracy value (Task I) and ``minimum average distance to Manhattan'' (Task II). Deep Learning algorithms, particularly those based on the EfficientNet architecture, achieved the best results in Task I. No winners were proclaimed for Task II. A detailed discussion of teams' proposed methods with corresponding ranking is presented in this paper.},

  abstract = {The integration of usable and flexible analysis support in modelling environments is a key success factor in Model-Driven Development. In this paradigm, models are the core asset from which code is automatically generated, and thus ensuring model correctness is a fundamental quality control activity. For this purpose, a common approach is to transform the system models into formal semantic domains for verification. However, if the analysis results are not shown in a proper way to the end-user (e.g. in terms of the original language) they may become useless. In this paper we present a novel DSVL called BaVeL that facilitates the flexible annotation of verification results obtained in semantic domains to different formats, including the context of the original language. BaVeL is used in combination with a consistency framework, providing support for all steps in a verification process: acquisition of additional input data, transformation of the system models into semantic domains, verification, and flexible annotation of analysis results. The approach has been validated analytically by the cognitive dimensions framework, and empirically by its implementation and application to several DSVLs. Here we present a case study of a notation in the area of Digital Libraries, where the analysis is performed by transformations into Petri nets and a process algebra. \copyright{} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This obituary records several phases of E.T.'s life and afterlife: its conception and compromised design as an Atari game program and ``worst game of all time,'' its shift from failed product to waste, and its afterlife status as relic and memorialized object.

  abstract = {The main objective of this thesis is to contribute to the theory of Conceptual Modeling by proposing ontological foundations for structural conceptual models. Conceptual Modeling is a discipline of great importance to several areas in Computer Science. Its main objective is concerned with identifying, analyzing and describing the essential concepts and constraints of a universe of discourse, with the help of a (diagrammatic) modeling language that is based on a set of basic modeling concepts (forming a metamodel). In this thesis, we show how conceptual modeling languages can be evaluated and (re)designed with the purpose of improving their ontological adequacy. In simple terms, ontological adequacy is a measure of how close the models produced using a modeling language are to the situations in the reality they are supposed to represent. The thesis starts by proposing a systematic evaluation method for comparing a metamodel of the concepts underlying a language to a reference ontology of the corresponding domain in reality. The focus of this thesis is on general conceptual modeling languages (as opposed to domain specific ones). Hence, the proposed reference ontology is a foundational (or upper-level) ontology. Moreover, since, it focuses on structural modeling aspects (as opposed to dynamic ones), this foundational ontology is an ontology of objects, their properties and relations, their parts, the roles they play, and the types they instantiate. The proposed ontology was developed by adapting and extending a number of theories coming, primarily, from formal ontology in philosophy, but also from cognitive science and linguistics. Once developed, every subtheory of the ontology is used in the creation of methodological tools (e.g., modeling profiles, guidelines and design patterns). The expressiveness and relevance of these tools are shown throughout the thesis to solve some classical and recurrent conceptual modeling problems. Finally, the thesis demonstrates the applicability and usefulness of both the method and the proposed ontology by analyzing and extending a fragment of the Unified Modeling Language (UML) which deals with the construction of structural conceptual models.},

In contrast to previous text games with mostly synthetic texts, IF games pose language understanding challenges on the human-written textual descriptions of diverse and sophisticated game worlds and language generation challenges on the action command generation from less restricted combinatorial space. We take a novel perspective of IF game solving and re-formulate it as Multi-Passage Reading Comprehension (MPRC) tasks. Our approaches utilize the context-query attention mechanisms and the structured prediction in MPRC to efficiently generate and evaluate action outputs and apply an object-centric historical observation retrieval strategy to mitigate the partial observability of the textual observations. Extensive experiments on the recent IF benchmark (Jericho) demonstrate clear advantages of our approaches achieving high winning rates and low data requirements compared to all previous approaches.

  abstract = {\copyright{} Emerald Group Publishing Limited.Findings: The results revealed that KM practices positively and meaningfully (though weak) impact overall organizational performance. This impact is significant only regarding growth and learning dimension and on the other dimensions is insignificant. Also, as customer and financial constructs were loaded on one factor based on the entity of their indicators we considered these two constructs as stakeholders construct. In addition, among the above mentioned seven CSFs, motivation and rewarding system obtained the lowest rank among the survey organizations.Research limitations/implications: The sample is restricted to only three companies, so gathering data from various parts of Iran including both manufacturing and service industries could increase the generalizability of the results obtained. Also, as in this study the data gathered were cross-sectional, a longitudinal study could help gain deeper understanding of the cause-and-effect relationship among the variables.Originality/value: The most significant gap in the literature is the lack of enough application of statistical and comprehensive methods like BSC that KM makes a difference to organizational performance. This study contributes to the field of KM by empirically investigating the impact of KM practices on various measures of organizational performance in order to prove the suitability of a comprehensive approach like BSC.Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to present a holistic approach regarding evaluation of knowledge management (KM) practices on organizational performance. The effects of seven critical success factors (CSFs), namely leadership role, organizational culture, KM strategy, processes and activities, training and education, information technology, and motivation and rewarding system, on organizational performance in the framework of four perspectives of balance scored card (BSC) approach were surveyed.Design/methodology/approach: The research hypotheses were raised based on the four perspectives of this approach, namely, growth and learning, internal processes, customer and financial. By literature review, CSFs of KM and organizational performance along with their items were identified in the framework of BSC's perspectives. Based on these constructs and their items an instrument was designed and distributed among managers and employees of the subsidiary firms of Iran National Petrochemical Company (INPC). Reliability of the instrument was calculated by Chronbach's {$\alpha$} for the two sections of the instrument i.e. KM practices and organizational performance. Also, using factor analysis the construct validity of the questionnaire was approved. Finally, based on the hypotheses of the study and using structural equation modeling the impacts of KM practices on organizational performance were investigated.},

  abstract = {Undoubtedly, the evolution of Generative AI (GenAI) models has been the highlight of digital transformation in the year 2022. As the different GenAI models like ChatGPT and Google Bard continue to foster their complexity and capability, it's critical to understand its consequences from a cybersecurity perspective. Several instances recently have demonstrated the use of GenAI tools in both the defensive and offensive side of cybersecurity, and focusing on the social, ethical and privacy implications this technology possesses. This research paper highlights the limitations, challenges, potential risks, and opportunities of GenAI in the domain of cybersecurity and privacy. The work presents the vulnerabilities of ChatGPT, which can be exploited by malicious users to exfiltrate malicious information bypassing the ethical constraints on the model. This paper demonstrates successful example attacks like Jailbreaks, reverse psychology, and prompt injection attacks on the ChatGPT. The paper also investigates how cyber offenders can use the GenAI tools in developing cyber attacks, and explore the scenarios where ChatGPT can be used by adversaries to create social engineering attacks, phishing attacks, automated hacking, attack payload generation, malware creation, and polymorphic malware. This paper then examines defense techniques and uses GenAI tools to improve security measures, including cyber defense automation, reporting, threat intelligence, secure code generation and detection, attack identification, developing ethical guidelines, incidence response plans, and malware detection. We will also discuss the social, legal, and ethical implications of ChatGPT. In conclusion, the paper highlights open challenges and future directions to make this GenAI secure, safe, trustworthy, and ethical as the community understands its cybersecurity impacts.},

Apex Legends is a multiplayer video game that has retained a large player base since its launch in 2019. This thesis argues that Apex Legends retains its player base because the game's serialization and paratexts keep players engaged with the game.  To study how Apex Legends engages its players, the thesis uses a framework that allows for the analysis of both the game's in-game seriality and the seriality of the game's paratexts. The theory section of the thesis also explains how seriality can be analyzed in video games without sequels. In addition, the thesis clarifies how the paratexts of Apex Legends are a part of a player's experience with the game. Apex Legends has received many updates, trailers, and user generated pieces of content during the time it has been playable. The thesis analyzes these different types of content to determine how they keep players returning to the game.  The analysis section of the thesis is divided into two sections. The first section is focused on how Apex Legends is serialized as a video game; this section examines how the game's in-game structure and narrative are serialized. The game's serialization into seasons that keep players engaged and playing the game is also discussed. The second section of the analysis focuses on the paratexts of Apex Legends and their serialization: the thesis argues that the trailers and animated shorts set in the world of the game work together with the game to create serial narratives. In addition, the second section analyzes how the paratexts produced by users of Apex Legends engage players with the game by keeping them interested in the game when they are not playing it.},

We show that injective matching provides additional expressiveness in two respects: for generating graph languages by grammars without non-terminals and for computing graph functions by convergent graph transformation systems. Then we clarify for each of the three variations whether the well-known commutativity, parallelism and concurrency theorems are still valid and -- where this is not the case -- give modified results. In particular, for the most general approach with injective matching and arbitrary right-hand morphisms, we establish sequential and parallel commutativity by appropriately strengthening sequential and parallel independence.},

  abstract = {More and more learning apps like Duolingo are using some form of gamification (e.g., badges, points, and leaderboards) to enhance user learning. However, they are not always successful. Gamification misuse is a phenomenon that occurs when users become too fixated on gamification and get distracted from learning. This undesirable phenomenon wastes users' precious time and negatively impacts their learning performance. However, there has been little research in the literature to understand gamification misuse and inform future gamification designs. Therefore, this paper aims to fill this knowledge gap by conducting the first extensive qualitative research on gamification misuse in a popular learning app called Duolingo. Duolingo is currently the world's most downloaded learning app used to learn languages. This study consists of two phases: (I)a content analysis of data from Duolingo forums (from the past nine years) and (II)semi-structured interviews with 15 international Duolingo users. Our research contributes to the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Learning at Scale (L@S) research communities in three ways: (1) elaborating the ramifications of gamification misuse on user learning, well-being, and ethics, (2) identifying the most common reasons for gamification misuse (e.g., competitiveness, overindulgence in playfulness, and herding), and (3) providing designers with practical suggestions to prevent (or mitigate) the occurrence of gamification misuse in their future designs of gamified learning apps.},

  abstract = {This paper proves that Dijkstra's shortest-path algorithm is universally optimal in both its running time and number of comparisons when combined with a sufficiently efficient heap data structure.  Universal optimality is a powerful beyond-worst-case performance guarantee for graph algorithms that informally states that a single algorithm performs as well as possible for every single graph topology. We give the first application of this notion to any sequential algorithm.  We design a new heap data structure with a working-set property guaranteeing that the heap takes advantage of locality in heap operations. Our heap matches the optimal (worst-case) bounds of Fibonacci heaps but also provides the beyond-worst-case guarantee that the cost of extracting the minimum element is merely logarithmic in the number of elements inserted after it instead of logarithmic in the number of all elements in the heap. This makes the extraction of recently added elements cheaper.  We prove that our working-set property is sufficient to guarantee universal optimality, specifically, for the problem of ordering vertices by their distance from the source vertex: The locality in the sequence of heap operations generated by any run of Dijkstra's algorithm on a fixed topology is strong enough that one can couple the number of comparisons performed by any heap with our working-set property to the minimum number of comparisons required to solve the distance ordering problem on this topology.},

  abstract = {Industry 4.0 is a new stage in the organisation and control of the industrial value chain, interchangeably with the fourth industrial revolution. It has a broad vision with well-defined frameworks and reference designs, focusing on bridging physical infrastructure and digital technology in so-called cyber-physical systems. Apart from the other essential technologies, Holography is considered a new innovative technology that can completely transform the vision of Industry 4.0. In industrial applications, holographic technology is used for quality control in manufacturing and fracture testing, such as holographic nondestructive testing. Holography has a wide range of applications in medicine, the military, weather forecasting, virtual reality, digital art, and security. The fourth industrial revolution aims to provide automated asset monitoring, decision-making for corporate operations, and real-time network connectivity. This paper explores holography and its significant benefits through various development processes, features, and applications, where the focus is on `holography for Industry 4.0'. Hologram technology is a new industry trend and can impact multiple domains of Industry 4.0. Furthermore, the adoption of holographic technologies may improve the efficiency of existing products and services in other technology sectors such as architecture, 3D modelling, mechatronics, robotics, and healthcare and medical engineering.},

  abstract = {There is often said to be a tension between the two types of organizational learning activities, exploration and exploitation. The argument goes that the two activities are substitutes, competing for scarce resources when firms need different capabilities and management policies. We present another explanation, attributing the tension to the dynamic interactions among search, knowledge sharing, evaluation and alignment within organizations. Our results show that successful organizations tend to bifurcate into two types: those that always promote individual initiatives and build organizational strengths on individual learning and those good at assimilating the individual knowledge base and exploiting shared knowledge. Straddling the two types often fails. The intuition is that an equal mixture of individual search and assimilation slows down individual learning, while at the same time making it difficult to update organizational knowledge because individuals' knowledge base is not sufficiently homogenized. Straddling is especially inefficient when the operation is sufficiently complex or when the business environment is sufficiently turbulent.},

  abstract = {In open and dynamic multiagent systems (MASs), agents often need to rely on resources or services provided by other agents to accomplish their goals. During this process, agents are exposed to the risk of being exploited by others. These risks, if not mitigated, can cause serious breakdowns in the operation of MASs and threaten their long-term wellbeing. To protect agents from the uncertainty in the behavior of their interaction partners, the age-old mechanism of trust between human beings is re-contexted into MASs. The basic idea is to let agents self-police the MAS by rating each other on the basis of their observed behavior and basing future interaction decisions on such information. Over the past decade, a large number of trust management models were proposed. However, there is a lack of research effort in several key areas, which are critical to the success of trust management in MASs where human beings and agents coexist. The purpose of this paper is to give an overview of existing research in trust management in MASs. We analyze existing trust models from a game theoretic perspective to highlight the special implications of including human beings in an MAS, and propose a possible research agenda to advance the state of the art in this field.},

  abstract = {Knowledge Representation and Reasoning is at the heart of the great challenge of Artificial Intelligence: to understand the nature of intelligence and cognition so well that computers can be made to exhibit human-like abilities. As early as 1958, John McCarthy contemplated Artificial Intelligence systems that could exercise common sense. From this and other earlywork, researchers gained the conviction that (artificial) intelligence could be formalized as symbolic reasoning with explicit representations of knowledge, and that the core research challenge is to figure out how to represent knowledge in computers and to use it algorithmically to solve problems. Fifty years later, this book surveys the substantial body of scientific and engineer- ing insights that constitute the field of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning. Advances have been made on three fronts. First, researchers have explored general methods of knowledge representation and reasoning, addressing fundamental issues that cut across application domains. Second, researchers have developed specialized methods of knowledge representation and reasoning to handle core domains, such as time, space, causation and action. Third, researchers have tackled important applica- tions of knowledge representation and reasoning, including query answering, planning and the Semantic Web. Accordingly, the book is divided into three sections to cover these themes.},

  abstract = {In this article, we present a decentralized convention formation framework for creating social conventions within large multiagent convention spaces. We study the role of the topological characteristics of the network in forming conventions with an emphasis on scale-free topologies. We hypothesize that contextual knowledge encapsulated in the topology can help improve both the quality of the emergent convention and the speed of forming such a convention. We also investigate the influence of network diversity. While recent research on diversity indicates that it improves organizational productivity, we observe that not all diversity is equally useful and identify the necessary conditions to maximize the benefit of diversity. We validate our convention formation framework using a language coordination problem in which agents in a multiagent system construct a common lexicon in a decentralized fashion. Agent interactions are modeled using a language game where every agent repeatedly plays with its neighbors. Each agent stochastically updates its lexicon based on the utility values of the lexicons received from its immediate neighbors. We introduce a novel contextaware utility computation mechanism and equip the agents with the ability to reorganize their neighborhood based on this utility estimate to expedite the convention formation process. A key idea behind our approach is the ability of socially influential high-utility-lexicon agents to bias their neighbors towards accepting their lexicons. Extensive experimentation results indicate that our proposed solution is both effective (able to converge into a large majority convention state with more than 90\% agents sharing a high-quality lexicon) and efficient (faster) as compared to state-of-the-art approaches for social conventions in large convention spaces.},

Interactive Fiction games are fully text-based simulation environments where a player issues text commands to effect change in the environment and progress through the story. We argue that IF games are an excellent testbed for studying language-based autonomous agents. In particular, IF games combine challenges of combinatorial action spaces, language understanding, and commonsense reasoning. To facilitate rapid development of languagebased agents, we introduce Jericho, a learning environment for man-made IF games and conduct a comprehensive study of text-agents across a rich set of games, highlighting directions in which agents can improve.},

Existing work largely focus on one functionality: either displaying vehicular info or scoring the driver. And some other work just provides navigation or Point of Interest (POI). In our work, we combine these features with minimal distraction for the driver. With this goal, we consider a system that interfaces to the vehicle bus and find the errors of the driver during the drive using multiple criteria. Furthermore, by providing achievements and leader boards, the driver is motivated to have a good score while driving. To facilitate this analysis and to evaluate the system, we recorded two trips in real traffic. The results show that we achieve more than 95\% accuracy between real-world scenario and the simulation. We also present POI feature that finds nearest preferred locations which are restaurants, hospitals, gas stations, pharmacies, car repair shops.},

This report aims to investigate if humans are able to distinguish questions written by humans from questions generated by computer as well as if AQG can be used to create exam questions for the Swedish national test. The results showed that the participants within the study were able to identify the generated questions in a majority of cases.

  abstract = {Computing as a discipline is maturing rapidly. However, with maturity often comes a plethora of subdisciplines, which, as time progresses, can become isolationist. The subdisciplines of modelling, metamodelling, ontologies and modelling languages within software engineering e.g. have, to some degree, evolved separately and without any underpinning formalisms. Introducing set theory as a consistent underlying formalism, Brian Henderson-Sellers shows how a coherent framework can be developed that clearly links these four, previously separate, areas of software engineering. In particular, he shows how the incorporation of a foundational ontology can be beneficial in resolving a number of controversial issues in conceptual modelling, especially with regard to the perceived differences between linguistic metamodelling and ontological metamodelling. An explicit consideration of domain-specific modelling languages is also included in his mathematical analysis of models, metamodels, ontologies and modelling languages.This encompassing and detailed presentation of the state-of-the-art in modelling approaches mainly aims at researchers in academia and industry. They will find the principled discussion of the various subdisciplines extremely useful, and they may exploit the unifying approach as a starting point for future research.},

The behavioral science paradigm seeks to develop and verify theories that explain or predict human or organizational behavior. The design-science paradigm seeks to extend the boundaries of human and organizational capabilities by creating new and innovative artifacts. Both paradigms are foundational to the IS discipline, positioned as it is at the confluence of people, organizations, and technology. Our objective is to describe the performance of design-science research in Information Systems via a concise conceptual framework and clear guidelines for understanding, executing, and evaluating the research. In the design-science paradigm, knowledge and understanding of a problem domain and its solution are achieved in the building and application of the designed artifact. Three recent exemplars in the research literature are used to demonstrate the application of these guidelines. We conclude with an analysis of the challenges of performing high-quality design-science research in the context of the broader IS community.},

In large populations, the formation of coalitions is often restricted by structural visibility and locality constraints under which agents can reorganize. We capture and study this aspect using a novel network-based model for dynamic locality within the popular framework of hedonic coalition formation games. We analyze the effects of network-based visibility and structure on the convergence of coalition formation processes to stable states. Our main result is a tight characterization of the structures based on which dynamic coalition formation can stabilize quickly. Maybe surprisingly, polynomial-time convergence can be achieved if and only if coalition formation is based on complete or star graphs.},

  abstract = {Background: Weight loss and maintenance are improved by effective communication. Technology-based interventions may improve short term behaviour change however many have used older technology such as text-messaging. The long-term benefits of technology are unknown, as is the effectiveness of chatbots (conversation-driven user interfaces) for delivering weight loss maintenance interventions. WeightMentor is a personalised motivational chatbot for weight loss maintenance. Aim: The aim of this PhD was to design, develop, and test the usability of WeightMentor, a personalised motivational chatbot to assist individuals with weight loss maintenance. Methods: This PhD was a mixed methods technology design and development project, comprising five individual studies: a review of literature relating to technology for weight loss maintenance, a needs analysis of the WeightMentor target users, designing and developing the WeightMentor chatbot, testing the usability of the WeightMentor chatbot, and validating the Chatbot Usability Questionnaire (CUQ), designed for measuring chatbot usability. Key Results: The needs analysis identified five key themes: ``Weight loss maintenance is a challenge'', ``Social contact can be a double-edged sword'', ``Apps are popular'', ``Personalised messages are more useful'' and ``Chatbots have potential for weight loss maintenance''. Participants considered the WeightMentor prototype to be engaging and simple. WeightMentor was designed using contemporary technologies to implement features that would be most useful for target users. WeightMentor scored well above conventional usability benchmarks. The minimum number of users required to identify most usability issues was 39, more than conventional wisdom suggests (n=5-8). During validation the CUQ demonstrated construct validity and test-retest reliability. Discussion/Conclusion: Weight loss maintenance is a challenge that may be supported using technology, and the newly developed chatbot, WeightMentor has the potential for weight loss maintenance as it is usability acceptable and is a solution that should be explored further.},

These include hierarchies, holarchies, coalitions, teams, congregations, societies, federations, markets, and matrix organizations. We will provide a description of each, discuss their advantages and disadvantages, and provide examples of how they may be instantiated and maintained. This summary will facilitate the comparative evaluation of organizational styles, allowing designers to first recognize the spectrum of possibilities, and then guiding the selection of an appropriate organizational design for a particular domain and environment.},

  abstract = {As the scale and scope of multi-agent systems grow, it becomes increasingly important to manage the manner in which the participants interact. The potential for bottlenecks, intractably large sets of coordination partners, and shared bounded resources can make individual and high-level goals difficult to achieve. To address these problems, many large systems employ an additional layer of structuring, known as an organizational design, that assigns agents particular and different roles, responsibilities and peers. These additional constraints can allow agents to operate effectively within a large-scale system. In this paper, we will introduce a domain-independent organizational design representation capable of modeling and predicting the quantitative performance characteristics of agent organizations. This representation supports the selection of an appropriate design given a particular operational context. We will demonstrate how the language can be used to represent complex interactions, and show modeling techniques that can address the combinatorics of large-scale agent systems.},

We introduce two simple global hyper-parameters that efficiently trade off between latency and accuracy. These hyper-parameters allow the model builder to choose the right sized model for their application based on the constraints of the problem. We present extensive experiments on resource and accuracy tradeoffs and show strong performance compared to other popular models on ImageNet classification. We then demonstrate the effectiveness of MobileNets across a wide range of applications and use cases including object detection, finegrain classification, face attributes and large scale geo-localization.},

Thus, this study aims at exploring the antecedents and consequences of user experience and its mediating role in an online gamification context. Specifically, this study uses structural equation modeling to test the causal relationships among perceived mobility, utilitarian and hedonic features, user experience, perceived benefits (selfbenefit and social benefit), types of perceived value (information value, experiential value, social value, and transaction value), and brand equity (perceived quality, brand loyalty, brand associations, and brand trust) in an online gamification context. Results show that perceived mobility has a significant impact on utilitarian and hedonic features, while perceived mobility and utilitarian and hedonic features influence user experience, which in turn, affects perceived benefits, types of perceived value, and brand equity. Additionally, the mediating effect of user experience is also confirmed in this study. In summary, the findings of this study can help website managers improve their users' perception of benefits, value, and brand equity more effectively and act as a guide to research and development (R\&D) of gamification to obtain competitive advantage in the online context.},

  abstract = {An increasing number of social computational systems consist of a great amount of autonomous entities and operate in highly dynamic and unpredictable environments. To construct such systems needs to seek high-level abstraction to manage the complexity of the systems and novel mechanism to support their characteristics, i.e., dynamism and flexibility. Agent-oriented programming (AOP) is considered as a potential paradigm for developing such systems by exhibiting a number of characteristics, such as autonomy, flexibility, social ability, etc. However, current researches on AOP mainly focus on the construction of multi-agent system (MAS) with theory and language facilities inspired from artificial intelligence (AI) and distributed AI, seldom considering and integrating the proven principles and practices of programming and software engineering. Moreover, abstractions and mechanism based on AI are inadequate for developing dynamic and flexible MAS in open environment. This paper proposes a novel AOP approach, namely Oragent, for constructing and implementing dynamic and flexible systems. From a software engineering perspective, Oragent integrates organizational concepts and mechanism into AOP language, and support the dynamism and flexibility with explicit primitives. The proposed approach consists of a programming model and a corresponding programming language. This paper presents the syntax and formal operational semantics of Oragent language, and studies a case to demonstrate our approach.},

To understand pet owners' behavioral intentions to use the chatbot for veterinary consultations, we modify the technology acceptance model to develop a usage intention model for the veterinary consultation chatbot. We survey members of a pet network community by using Google Forms to collect data and partial least squares structural equation modeling for analysis. The results indicate that the perceived accuracy, perceived completeness, and perceived ease of use increased pet owners' user satisfaction of veterinary consultation chatbot; the perceived convenience and pet owners' user satisfaction increased pet owners' behavioral intention to use chatbot for veterinary consultations. This study can be used as a basis for evaluation of using intelligent technologies in pet healthcare consultation and pet disease management.},

  abstract = {The enhancement of human senses electronically is possible when pervasive computers interact unnoticeably with humans in ubiquitous computing. The design of computer user interfaces towards ``disappearing'' forces the interaction with humans using a content rather than a menu driven approach, thus the emerging requirement for huge number of non-technical users interfacing intuitively with billions of computers in the Internet of Things is met. Learning to use particular applications in ubiquitous computing is either too slow or sometimes impossible so the design of user interfaces must be naturally enough to facilitate intuitive human behaviours. Although humans from different racial, cultural and ethnic backgrounds own the same physiological sensory system, the perception to the same stimuli outside the human bodies can be different. A novel taxonomy for disappearing user interfaces (DUIs) to stimulate human senses and to capture human responses is proposed. Furthermore, applications of DUIs are reviewed. DUIs with sensor and data fusion to simulate the sixth sense is explored. Enhancement of human senses through DUIs and context awareness is discussed as the groundwork enabling smarter wearable devices for interfacing with human emotional memories.},

  abstract = {"Gamification" has gained considerable scholarly and practitioner attention; however, the discussion in academia has been largely confined to the human-computer interaction and game studies domains. Since gamification is often used in service design, it is important that the concept be brought in line with the service literature. So far, though, there has been a dearth of such literature. This article is an attempt to tie in gamification with service marketing theory, which conceptualizes the consumer as a co-producer of the service. It presents games as service systems composed of operant and operand resources. It proposes a definition for gamification, one that emphasizes its experiential nature. The definition highlights four important aspects of gamification: affordances, psychological mediators, goals of gamification and the context of gamification. Using the definition the article identifies four possible gamifying actors and examines gamification as communicative staging of the service environment.},

It examined the perception of telemedicine services and the current status of the companion animal industry, the app platform, and its applied technology by industry domain, and four representative types of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies applicable in the medical field. A survey was conducted through an app implementing pet telemedicine, and hypotheses were established and statistically tested based on the adoption period of pets, health status, mobile service utilization (as an index measuring the ease of use of recent AI functions), and positive and negative perceptions of telemedicine services. As revealed by prospect theory, users with a negative perception of pet telemedicine tended to maintain negative perceptions about telemedicine for humans. This study proved that the severity of pet diseases and the ease of use of recent AI technologies act as a moderating effect on the perception of telemedicine services through the verification of reinforcement and additional hypotheses. It suggests a plan to overcome sanctions against telemedicine by utilizing AI technology. A positive effect on changing the medical paradigm to telemedicine and the improvement of the medical legal system were also observed.},

Other enterprises prefer to adopt voluntary courses or programs, but in this case enrollment and completion depend on many factors: the time that workers can spend on training without compromising their main tasks; the directives of managers; the individual motivation. Another way to face corporate training may exploit gamification to enhance engagement. The authors present the design and implementation of a gamified course of office automation, developed for the employees of a large media company.

However, we argue that this is not a realistic assumption, as agents may not want to divulge this information or are even incapable of expressing it. To mitigate this, we propose the multi-criteria coalition formation game model, in which there are different publicly available quality metrics (corresponding to different criteria) for which a value is publicly available for each coalition. The agents have private utility functions that determine their preferences with respect to these criteria, and thus also with respect to the different coalitions. Assuming that we can ask agents to compare two coalitions, we propose a heuristic (best response) algorithm for finding stable partitions in MC2FGs: local stability search (LSS). We show that while theoretically individually stable partitions need not exist in MC2FGs in general, empirically stable partitions can be found. Furthermore, we show that we can find individually stable partitions after asking only a small number of comparisons, which is highly important for applying this model in practice.},

  abstract = {Many applications are developed to assist in practicing zero waste, but the number of users for such applications is few. In this research, interaction for a new zero-waste application that uses gamification was designed to increase the number of users. The usage of gamification focused on cooperative elements because the practice of zero waste involves collaboration to achieve a mutual goal of decreasing waste. The design process used a user-centered design (UCD) approach, with the final product in a prototype application for a mobile device. The interface design aims for effectiveness and utility as usability goals, while its user experience goals are helpful and motivating. Based on usability testing conducted on the prototype, it is concluded that cooperative gamification elements usable in zero-waste applications include user groups, user roles, group-based goals, and cumulative points. The achievement of usability and user experience goals is measured using several metrics. They are success rate, single ease questions (SEQ), System Usability Scale (SUS), Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) subscale Value/Usefulness, and IMI subscale Interest/Enjoyment for measuring motivation.},

In order to develop ontologies, several methodologies have been proposed during the last two decades. Despite the fact, that quite a number of ontology engineering methodologies have been proposed, still the field lacks widely accepted and mature methodologies. Most methodologies lack sufficient details of techniques and activities employed in them. However, some methodologies provide sufficient details including METHONTOLOGY. This article discusses and reports a critical analysis and comparison of these methodologies. The analysis is performed based on a criterion, derived from related literature, trends and needs which evolved over the years. The results of the analysis showed that there is no completely mature methodology. Therefore, this research may act as a preliminary guide to come with a state of art ontology engineering methodology, bridging up the existing gaps and shortfalls.},

People's opinions, which products they buy, whether they invest in education, become criminals, and so forth, are all influenced by friends and acquaintances. Ultimately, the full network of relationships---how dense it is, whether some groups are segregated, who sits in central positions---affects how information spreads and how people behave. Increased availability of data coupled with increased computing power allows us to analyze networks in economic settings in ways not previously possible. In this paper, I describe some of the ways in which networks are helping economists to model and understand behavior. I begin with an example that demonstrates the sorts of things that researchers can miss if they do not account for network patterns of interaction. Next I discuss a taxonomy of network properties and how they impact behaviors. Finally, I discuss the problem of developing tractable models of network formation.},

However, the real world contains multiple agents, each learning and acting independently to cooperate and compete with other agents. We used a tournament-style evaluation to demonstrate that an agent can achieve human-level performance in a three-dimensional multiplayer first-person video game, Quake III Arena in Capture the Flag mode, using only pixels and game points scored as input. We used a two-tier optimization process in which a population of independent RL agents are trained concurrently from thousands of parallel matches on randomly generated environments. Each agent learns its own internal reward signal and rich representation of the world. These results indicate the great potential of multiagent reinforcement learning for artificial intelligence research.},

Their state and action spaces are combinatorially large, their reward function is sparse, and they are partially observable: the agent is informed of the consequences of its actions through textual feedback. In this paper we emphasize this latter point and consider the design of a deep reinforcement learning agent that can play from feedback alone. Our design recognizes and takes advantage of the structural characteristics of textbased games. We first propose a contextualisation mechanism, based on accumulated reward, which simplifies the learning problem and mitigates partial observability. We then study different methods that rely on the notion that most actions are ineffectual in any given situation, following Zahavy et al.'s idea of an admissible action. We evaluate these techniques in a series of text-based games of increasing difficulty based on the TextWorld framework, as well as the iconic game ZORK. Empirically, we find that these techniques improve the performance of a baseline deep reinforcement learning agent applied to text-based games.},

This paper proposes a general approach to find suboptimal solutions for a large-scale coalition formation problem containing thousands of agents using multi-agent simulation. We model coalition formation as an iterative process in which agents join and leave coalitions, and we propose several valuation functions that assign values to the coalitions. We propose several coalition selection strategies that agents may use to decide whether or not to leave their current coalition and which coalition to join. We also show how these valuation functions and coalition selection strategies represent specific coalition formation applications. Finally, we show almostoptimal performance of our algorithms in small-scale scenarios by comparing our solutions with an optimal solution, and we show stable performance in a large-scale setting in which searching for the optimal solution is not feasible.},

  abstract = {The computer gaming industry has today become bigger than the world music and movie industries. The influence of computer games over the youth of today is akin to that of the cultural influence of music, political movements and even religion on youth culture of the past. Of late, computer games have been attracting people of all kinds into using computers. They have driven the spread of computers into the lives of individuals who had earlier had no incentive to use them. Computer games are gaining unprecedented access to the homes, minds and souls of people today. Hence it has become increasingly important for game developers and educators to study the application of computers for enhancing the education offered to the next generation of students. Computer games can be used to give a better form of education and can even make computers become the unique tools of learning. The paper will present the current scenarios of computer games being used for the purposes of education and training. It will also dwell on areas in which the tremendous capabilities of computer games as an education medium can be utilized in educating a new generation of students weaned on computer games. New possibilities for computer games as tools of knowledge will also be projected.},

  abstract = {Past research conducted in in-person classrooms has demonstrated that helping behav\- ior---requesting and giving help in academic settings---plays an important role in learning. However, little is known about peer-to-peer help-giving in online learning environments, and online students may find it difficult to receive the help they need to succeed. Specifically, we have little knowledge of the factors contributing to productive helping behavior in online spaces, as well as how these factors may support students' online learning experiences. Thus, the aim of the present study was to understand the conditions underlying effective peer help-giving in online college course discussion forums. To this end, we surveyed 88 college students about what they found helpful or unhelpful in examples of replies to requests for help posted to an online statistics college course discussion forum. A qualitative analysis of participants' written responses using a grounded theory approach yielded a model for assessing the helpfulness of peer help-giving re\- plies within the discussion forum context. We learned that online help-giving replies could take the form of direct help---such as being elaborated, accurate, relevant, and/or understandable to the help-seeker---or indirect help---such as being encouraging, resource providing, calling to the community, and/or being concise. Our emergent online-specific model of academic help-giving contributes to existing theory by illustrating how peer help-giving replies can be structured to promote social, cognitive, and teaching presence in online communities of inquiry. Ultimately, these findings could inform practices that improve online learning opportunities for students.},

But across age groups, even just in the United States, more than 50\% of people with any mental illness (AMI) did not seek or receive any service or treatment. The proliferation of telehealth and telepsychiatry tools and systems can help address this crisis, but outside of traditional regulatory aspects on privacy, e.g. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA), there does not seem to be enough attention on the security needs, concerns, or user experience of people with AMI using those telehealth systems. In this text, I try to explore some priority security properties for telehealth systems used by people with AMI for mental heath services (MHS). I will also suggest some key steps in a proposed process for designing and building security mechanisms into such systems, so that security is accessible and usable to patients with AMI, and these systems can achieve their goals of ameliorate this mental health crisis.},

Despite the transformative benefits that CPPS provides, its increased connectivity exposes manufacturers to cyber-attacks through exploitable vulnerabilities. This paper presents a novel approach to CPPS security protection by leveraging digital twin (DT) technology to develop a comprehensive security model. This model enhances asset visibility and supports prioritization in mitigating vulnerable components through DT-based virtual tuning, providing quantitative assessment results for effective mitigation. Our proposed DT security model also serves as an advanced simulation environment, facilitating the evaluation of CPPS vulnerabilities across diverse attack scenarios without disrupting physical operations. The practicality and effectiveness of our approach are illustrated through its application in a human--robot collaborative assembly system, demonstrating the potential of DT technology.},

Participants form links based on a cost-benefit analysis. We examine the pairwise stable networks within this spatial environment. Incentives vary enough to show a rich pattern of emerging behavior. We also investigate the subgame perfect implementation of pairwise stable and efficient networks. We construct a multistage extensive form game that describes the formation of links in our spatial environment. Finally, we identify the conditions under which the subgame perfect Nash equilibria of these network formation games are stable.},

Minecraft is an ideal foundation for such a platform, as it exposes agents to complex 3D worlds, coupled with infinitely varied game-play. Project Malmo provides a sophisticated abstraction layer on top of Minecraft that supports a wide range of experimentation scenarios, ranging from navi-gation and survival to collaboration and problem solving tasks. In this demo we present the Malmo platform and its capabilities. The platform is pub-licly released as open source software at IJCAI, to support openness and collaboration in AI research.},

  abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to propose a theoretical-conceptual model supporting the analysis of the effects of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) networks on knowledge management (KM) and intellectual capital (IC). Design/methodology/approach The paper reviews literature on KM, IC and networks theories. The role of SMEs networks on KM and IC was discussed, analysing previous studies that supported the proposition of the model in question. In such model SMEs networks are seen as knowledge networks which are analysed in terms of the network formation process, the context, the strategy, the organisational culture and the stimuli for the sharing of knowledge. KM is observed in terms of knowledge creation, systematisation and sharing. Finally, IC encompasses human capital, structural capital and relational capital. It is noteworthy that KM and IC were considered deeply and closely related. Findings The conclusions obtained help to fill an important gap in the management, accounting, KM and IC literature, showing that the processes of creating, acquiring, maintaining, systematising and sharing information and knowledge and IC generation in SMEs networks can be influenced by the network formation process, by the organisational context, as well as by the strategy, organisational culture and stimuli to sharing knowledge. Research limitations/implications The paper provides a theoretical contribution by increasing understanding of the effect of SMEs networks on KM and IC practices ? an understanding still at the early stages in the literature. Moreover, the originality of the model proposed extends the relevance of this research, as the literature does not contain a sufficiently established and tested approach that simultaneously provides a clear view of the relations between SMEs, networks, KM and IC, highlighting how SMEs can use networks as a strategy to achieve a more effective management of the knowledge assets forming IC. So, the paper offers several avenues for future research. Practical implications Based on previous empirical research, it was perceived that the original model presented in this paper is consistent, collaborating to improve management practice, providing a competitive benchmarking process. This can allow analysts, managers and other decision makers, by using SMEs networks to improve organisational performance, innovation, sustainability, competitiveness and value. Originality/value The paper presents an innovative theoretical-conceptual model focussed on the role of SMEs networks on KM and IC, indicating a strong link between the former and the latter in such enterprises in terms of performance, innovation, sustainability, competitiveness and value, an issue whose understanding, although quite relevant, is still incipient in the literature.},

In addition to computation and control, communication plays a crucial role in the overall functionality of such a system. Wireless Sensor Networks are one such class of networks, which meet these criteria. These networks consist of spatially distributed sensor motes which work in a co-operative manner to sense and control the environment. In this work, an implementation of an energy-efficient and cost-effective, wireless sensor networks based vehicle parking system for a multi-floor indoor parking facility has been introduced. The system monitors the availability of free parking slots and guides the vehicle to the nearest free slot. The amount of time the vehicle has been parked is monitored for billing purposes. The status of the motes (dead/alive) is also recorded. Information like slot allocated, directions to the slot and billing data is sent as a message to customer's mobile phones. This paper extends our previous work [1] with the development of a low cost sensor mote, about one tenth the cost of a commercially available mote, keeping in mind the price sensitive markets of the developing countries.

  abstract = {Streaming video games, that is, live broadcasting playing video games on the internet, is incredibly popular. Millions tune into twitch.tv daily to watch eSport tournaments, their favourite streamer, and chat with other viewers. But all is not rosy in the world of streaming games. Recently, some game developers have aggressively exercised their copyright to, firstly, claim part of the streamers' revenue, and secondly, control the context in which their game is shown. The article analyzes whether game developers have, and should have, such rights under EU copyright law. Reaching the conclusion that video game streams infringe the game developer's right to communicate their works to the public, I argue that freedom of expression can and should be used to rein in their rights in certain cases. Subjecting the lawfulness of streams to game developers' good will risks stifling the expressions of streamers. The streamers, their audience, and even the copyright holders, would be worse off for it.},

  abstract = {In computer science, an ontology is a way of showing the properties of a subject area and how they are related by defining a set of concepts and categories that represent the subject. There have been many attempts to create a widely accepted ontology for the universe of games. Most of these attempts are defined based on an analytical perspective: few have found frequent use outside universities, as they are not easily translated to the development of games, which is a design perspective. There are some core aspects of the domain that turn this task into a difficult goal to achieve. In addition, game designers tend to refuse a methodology or a structured way of developing a game; the main concern is that it can impair creativity in a field that could not survive without it. A defined ontology would improve and mature the growing industry of digital games, both by enhancing the understanding of the domain and by supporting a structured methodology for designing games. This paper describes the properties of digital games and shows how they make it difficult to create an ontology for that field of study, especially when it comes to a design perspective. It clarifies the closest approach to a unified ontology that there is for the game domain: the mechanics, dynamics and aesthetics framework (MDA). We propose the redefinition of MDA's taxonomy, calling it Redefining the MDA (RMDA), providing better use for the approach from a designer's perspective, embracing the design properties of the domain, and overcoming issues found in the literature of the game domain. The main purpose of this paper is to clarify the MDA framework by redefining its main components, mechanics, dynamics and aesthetics, as a way to make the tool more understandable and useful for game designers. Understanding aesthetics and how developers can invoke them by correctly defining mechanics and creating dynamics is the main focus of the paper. Thus, some examples are provided in order to explain the applicability of the RMDA as a methodology to produce games.},

Implementing technology in science curricula has seen a massive influx over the past years to stop the decline in students' motivation towards science learning and promote scientific thinking. This study's objective is to present the empirical findings of the state-of-the-art literature on the use of gamification in science education. Therefore, we performed a systematic literature review of 24 empirical research papers published in various electronic databases and the web search engine for scholarly literature and academic resources, Google Scholar, between 2012 and 2020. This review reveals the latest emerging trends of gamification in science education while revealing the literature gap, challenges, impediments, and extending the possibilities for future research directions. It examines the conflicting findings of other studies and provides a framework and insight for future researchers regarding content areas, educational levels, theoretical models, outcomes, methodologies, game elements, and assessment tools.},

The approach has emerged from experiences with meta-modeling projects developed within the frame of the Open Model Initiative Laboratory (OMILab), where flexibility challenges have been raised by (a) evolving modeling requirements, (b) modeling requirements propagating from run-time systems requirements, as well as (c) requirements pertaining to domain-specificity.

  abstract = {This book represents the result of a community effort and cooperation to create and develop modeling methods and languages, based on the OMiLAB1 Collaborative Environment. It aims to increase the visibility of domain-specific conceptual modeling by presenting work of thought leaders who designed and deployed a specific modeling method. Furthermore it provides a hands-on guidance on how to build models in a particular domain, such as requirements in engineering, business process modeling or enterprise architecture. Not only the results are presented, but also the ideas for future developments are communicated. All this is enriched with any exercises, case studies, papers and updated infor- mation the authors deem important. All domain-specific methods described in this volume have also a tool implementation within the OMiLAB. This opens up possibilities to involve a wide community of further developers and users. The Open Models Laboratory (OMiLAB) is a dedicated research and experi- mentation space for modeling method engineering. Being both a physical and virtual place, it is equipped with tools to explore method creation and design, experiment with method engineering and deploy software tools for modeling. The laboratory offers also a portal, through which the scientific community can bring in their ideas related to conceptual modeling issues and engage in their exploration process. We are confident that this book will benefit experts and practitioners from academia and industry, members of the conceptual modeling community as well as lecturers and students. A large scientific community was involved in creating this book and we would like to extend our gratitude to each and everyone for their contribution. First of all, we thank all the authors who submitted their work and provided their expertise in this field, and reviewers for their helpful feedback. Our special thanks to Ms. Iulia Vaidian for administrative support of the editors, also to Prof. Ovidiu Matiu for language editing. We are thankful for the support received from the team at Springer led by Ralf Gerstner in the publication of this book. We highly appreciate the efforts from all of those involved!},

  abstract = {A major scientific revolution has begun, a new paradigm that rivalsDarwin's theory in importance. At its heart is the discovery of theorder that lies deep within the most complex of systems, from the originof life, to the workings of giant corporations, to the rise and fall ofgreat civilizations. And more than anyone else, this revolution is thework of one man, Stuart Kauffman, a MacArthur Fellow and visionarypioneer of the new science of complexity. Now, in At Home in theUniverse , Kauffman brilliantly weaves together the excitement ofintellectual discovery and a fertile mix of insights to give the generalreader a fascinating look at this new science-and at the forces fororder that lie at the edge of chaos.We all know of instances ofspontaneous order in nature-an oil droplet in water forms a sphere,snowflakes have a six-fold symmetry. What we are only now discovering,Kauffman says, is that the range of spontaneous order is enormouslygreater than we had supposed. Indeed, self-organization is a greatundiscovered principle of nature. But how does this spontaneous orderarise? Kauffman contends that complexity itself triggersself-organization, or what he calls "order for free," that if enoughdifferent molecules pass a certain threshold of complexity, they beginto self-organize into a new entity-a living cell. Kauffman uses theanalogy of a thousand buttons on a rug-join two buttons randomly withthread, then another two, and so on. At first, you have isolated pairs;later, small clusters; but suddenly at around the 500th repetition, aremarkable transformation occurs-much like the phase transition whenwater abruptly turns to ice-and the buttons link up in one giantnetwork. Likewise, life may have originated when the mix of differentmolecules in the primordial soup passed a certain level of complexityand self-organized into living entities (if so, then life is not ahighly improbable chance event, but almost inevitable). Kauffman usesthe basic insight of "order for free" to illuminate a staggering rangeof phenomena. We see how a single-celled embryo can grow to a highlycomplex organism with over two hundred different cell types. We learnhow the science of complexity extends Darwin's theory of evolution bynatural selection: that self-organization, selection, and chance are theengines of the biosphere. And we gain insights into biotechnology, thestunning magic of the new frontier of genetic engineering-generatingtrillions of novel molecules to find new drugs, vaccines, enzymes,biosensors, and more. Indeed, Kauffman shows that ecosystems, economicsystems, and even cultural systems may all evolve according to similargeneral laws, that tissues and terra cotta evolve in similar ways. Andfinally, there is a profoundly spiritual element to Kauffman's thought.If, as he argues, life were bound to arise, not as an incalculablyimprobable accident, but as an expected fulfillment of the naturalorder, then we truly are at home in the universe. Kauffman's earliervolume, The Origins of Order , written for specialists, received lavishpraise. Stephen Jay Gould called it "a landmark and a classic." AndNobel Laureate Philip Anderson wrote that "there are few people in thisworld who ever ask the right questions of science, and they are the oneswho affect its future most profoundly. Stuart Kauffman is one of these."In At Home in the Universe , this visionary thinker takes you along ashe explores new insights into the nature of life.},

Population Ageing has been represented as increasing ratio of older population over total population. The demographic transitions include fertility, mortality, migration and ageing transition are impacted on population ageing. The main cause of increase in population ageing is ageing dynamics. These dynamics differ by age and sex because population growth takes place age by age and differently from males to females. Modeling of population ageing caused by ageing dynamics are done either by using multi-agent based simulation or by micro-simulation. Both the strategies perform different multi-dimensional simulation probes ageing dynamics related procedures. These simulation strategies are being utilized increasingly in the sociologies. We will investigate these strategies and propose another strategy which illustrates the ageing dynamics in artificial agent societies. An artificial agent society is a synthetic representation of a society, which contains artificial humans called agents.},

We organize geolocalized and temporal information on users' tracked trips into a rich dataset that decision-makers can exploit to analyze citizens' daily transportation choices and balance the demand and the offer of the mobility ecosystem. Through the Gamification Platform, we define three different use case scenarios - i.e., mobility within the city, home-work mobility, and home-school mobility. We also evaluate the platform according to both gameful design guidelines and persuasive technology best practices. Our findings show how long-term retention and engagement can be achieved when the gameful system's design and maintenance are assisted by the Gamification Platform, merging both administrative requirements and users' needs towards an iteratively adaptive and personalized experience.},

  abstract = {"Artificial Intelligence is a disruptive technology across business and society. There are three long-term trends driving this AI revolution: the emergence of Big Data, the creation of cheaper and more powerful computers, and development of better algorithms for processing an learning from data. Deep learning is the subfield of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on creating large neural network models that are capable of making accurate data driven decisions. Modern neural networks are the most powerful computational models we have for analyzing massive and complex datasets, and consequently deep learning is ideally suited to take advantage of the rapid growth in Big Data and computational power. In the last ten years, deep learning has become the fundamental technology in computer vision systems, speech recognition on mobile phones, information retrieval systems, machine translation, game AI, and self-driving cars. It is set to have a massive impact in healthcare, finance, and smart cities over the next years. This book is designed to give an accessible and concise, but also comprehensive, introduction to the field of Deep Learning. The book explains what deep learning is, how the field has developed, what deep learning can do, and also discusses how the field is likely to develop in the next 10 years. Along the way, the most important neural network architectures are described, including autoencoders, recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory networks, convolutional networks, and more recent developments such as Generative Adversarial Networks, transformer networks, and capsule networks. The book also covers the two more important algorithms for training a neural network, the gradient descent algorithm and Backpropagation"--},

Atari 2600 games, however, do not resemble real-world tasks since they involve non-realistic 2D environments and the third-person perspective. Here, we propose a novel test-bed platform for reinforcement learning research from raw visual information which employs the first-person perspective in a semi-realistic 3D world. The software, called ViZDoom, is based on the classical first-person shooter video game, Doom. It allows developing bots that play the game using the screen buffer. ViZDoom is lightweight, fast, and highly customizable via a convenient mechanism of user scenarios. In the experimental part, we test the environment by trying to learn bots for two scenarios: a basic move-and-shoot task and a more complex maze-navigation problem. Using convolutional deep neural networks with Q-learning and experience replay, for both scenarios, we were able to train competent bots, which exhibit human-like behaviors. The results confirm the utility of ViZDoom as an AI research platform and imply that visual reinforcement learning in 3D realistic first-person perspective environments is feasible.},

  abstract = {In recent years, university teaching methods have evolved and almost all higher education institutions use e-learning platforms to deliver courses and learning activities. However, these digital learning environments present significant dropout and low completion rates. This is primarily due to the~lack of student~motivation and~engagement. Gamification which can be defined as the application of game design elements in~non-game~activities has been used to address the issue of learner distraction and stimulate students' involvement in the course. However, choosing the right combination of game elements remains a challenge for gamification designers and practitioners~due to the lack of proven design approaches, and there is no one-size-fits-all approach that works regardless of the gamification context. Therefore, our study focused on providing a comprehensive overview of the current state of gamification in online learning in higher education that can serve as a resource for gamification practitioners when designing gamified systems. In this paper, we aimed to systematically explore the different game elements and gamification theory that have been~used in empirical studies; establish different ways in which these game elements have been combined and provide a review of the state-of-the-art of approaches proposed in the literature for gamifying e-learning systems in higher education. A systematic search of databases was conducted to select articles related to gamification in digital higher education for this review, namely, Scopus and Google Scholar databases. We included studies that consider the definition of gamification as the application of game design elements in non-game activities, designed for online higher education. We excluded papers that use the term of gamification to refer to game-based learning, serious games, games, video games, and those that consider face-to-face learning environments. We found that PBL elements (points, badges, and leaderboards), levels, and feedback and are the most commonly used elements for gamifying e-learning systems in higher education. We also observed the increasing use of deeper elements like challenges and storytelling. Furthermore, we noticed that of 39 primary studies, only nine studies were underpinned by motivational theories, and only two other~studies used theoretical gamification frameworks proposed in the literature to build their e-learning systems. Finally, our classification of gamification approaches reveals the trend~towards customization and personalization in gamification and highlights the lack of studies on content gamification compared to structural gamification.},

  abstract = {Computer vision has become increasingly important and effective in recent years due to its wide-ranging applications in areas as diverse as smart surveillance and monitoring, health and medicine, sports and recreation, robotics, drones, and self-driving cars. Visual recognition tasks, such as image classification, localization, and detection, are the core building blocks of many of these applications, and recent developments in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have led to outstanding performance in these state-of-the-art visual recognition tasks and systems. As a result, CNNs now form the crux of deep learning algorithms in computer vision. This self-contained guide will benefit those who seek to both understand the theory behind CNNs and to gain hands-on experience on the application of CNNs in computer vision. It provides a comprehensive introduction to CNNs starting with the essential concepts behind neural networks: training, regularization, and optimization of CNNs. The book also discusses a wide range of loss functions, network layers, and popular CNN architectures, reviews the different techniques for the evaluation of CNNs, and presents some popular CNN tools and libraries that are commonly used in computer vision. Further, this text describes and discusses case studies that are related to the application of CNN in computer vision, including image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, scene understanding, and image generation. This book is ideal for undergraduate and graduate students, as no prior background knowledge in the field is required to follow the material, as well as new researchers, developers, engineers, and practitioners who are interested in gaining a quick understanding of CNN models.},

Capability of absorbing, sharing, and applying CK can be a challenge for organizations. Human, Organizational, and Technological conditions that facilitate CK management (CKM) are vital capabilities for organizations. This article intends to delve into the world of CKM by appraising and scrutinizing the present state of research and extracting organizational, individual, and technological CKM precursor factors. On the basis of a systematic literature review, this study gathers, integrates, and scrutinizes 66 papers pertaining to CKM precursor factors published during the period 2003-2016 on seven databases by adhering to a predefined review convention. The chosen articles have been appraised so as to mine pertinent information on a series of research questions. We noted a general rise in the number of related papers in the last 8-year period. Selected articles have investigated CKM in 14 different contexts and 19 different countries. The result of extracting CKM antecedent factors shows that ``Customer-Centric Culture,'' ``Collaboration System,'' and ``CRM Technology Infrastructure'' have the most frequency in the literature. However, ``Intellectual Property,'' ``Program Champion,?'' and ``Trust'' are less iterative factors. Therefore, companies and researchers can use the result of this research for developing Human, Organization, and Technological capabilities in order to implement CKM successfully.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a system that automatically generates multiple, natural language questions using relative pronouns and relative adverbs from complex English sentences. Our system is syntax-based, runs on dependency parse information of a single-sentence input, and achieves high accuracy in terms of syntactic correctness, semantic adequacy, fluency and uniqueness. One of the key advantages of our system, in comparison with other rulebased approaches, is that we nearly eliminate the chances of getting a wrong whword in the generated question, by fetching the requisite wh-word from the input sentence itself. Depending upon the input, we generate both factoid and descriptive type questions. To the best of our information, the exploitation of wh-pronouns and wh-adverbs to generate questions is novel in the Automatic Question Generation task.},

  abstract = {Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) have received much attention in recent years because of their advantages on modeling complex distributed systems, such Digital Ecosystems (DESs). Many existing modeling languages that support the design of such systems are based on ontologies to assist the representation of agents knowledge. However, in the context of DESs, there is still a need for more general conceptual models to represent the specific characteristics of DESs in terms of win-win interaction, engagement, equilibrium, and self-organization. Then, concepts such behavior, roles, rules, and environment are needed. This paper describes an ontologybased approach by proposing MAS2DES-Onto, as the conceptual model, which considers the essential static and dynamic aspects of MASs by a clear representation of their concepts and relationships to support the design and development of DESs. To validate and conduct experimental tests, we integrate MAS2DES-Onto into a framework to automatically generate MAS-based DESs. Results show the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach.},

  abstract = {It appears that interest in the Internet of things (IoT) has recently reached its peak, with a great deal of focus from both the private and public sectors. IoT, a technology that enables the exchange of data through linkage among all objects surrounding the user, can create new services. Data communication among objects is not limited to personal information, but can also deliver different data types, such as sensing information collected from the surrounding environment. When such data is collected and used maliciously by an attacker, it is more vulnerable to threats than in conventional network environments. Security of all data transmitted in the IoT environment is therefore essential for preventing attacks. However, it is difficult to apply the conventional cipher algorithm to lightweight devices. Therefore, we propose a method for sharing and managing data using the conventional cipher algorithm on lightweight devices in various circumstances. This method implements proxy re-encryption in order to manage data with fewer encryptions, and provides a data sharing function to supplement the insufficient capacity of lightweight device networks.},

A range of architectures and design principles has been proposed to solve this problem. This has led to the development of simulated worlds that can serve as testbeds in which the effectiveness of different agents can be evaluated. We report here an experimental program that aimed to investigate how commitment to goals contributes to effective behaviour and to compare the properties of different strategies for reacting to change. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of developing systems for empirical measurement of agent performance that are stable, sensitive, and capable of revealing the effect of "high-level" agent characteristics such as commitment.},

  abstract = {The simulation of societies requires vast amounts of computing resources, which must be managed over distributed or high performance computing infrastructures to provide for cost-effective experimentation. To that end, this paper presents a novel platform for the segmentation and management of social simulation experiments in game-playing multi-agent systems; the platform, also serves as a working proof of concept for similar experiments. The platform is managed through a web-based graphical user interface, to combine the advantages of powerful grid infrastructure middleware and sophisticated workflow systems in a way that some generic functionality is sacrificed for the benefit of obtaining a smooth and brief learning curve, without compromising security. The paper sets out the architecture and implementation details of the platform and demonstrates its use with two sample games, RLGame and Rock Scissors Paper, to underline the scale of the experiments and to indicate the class of social simulation problems that it can help investigate. The platform can be loosely coupled with analytics software for data mining; for our sample problems, this analysis leads to associating the learning mechanism each agent employs with its eventual performance ranking.},

It uncovered the principles of the world we live in, and enabled us to invent new technologies reshaping our society, cure diseases, explore unknown new frontiers, and hopefully lead us to build a sustainable society. Accelerating the speed of scientific discovery is therefore one of the most important endeavors. This requires an in-depth understanding of not only the subject areas but also the nature of scientific discoveries themselves. In other words, the ``science of science'' needs to be established, and has to be implemented using artificial intelligence (AI) systems to be practically executable. At the same time, what may be implemented by ``AI Scientists'' may not resemble the scientific process conducted by human scientist. It may be an alternative form of science that will break the limitation of current scientific practice largely hampered by human cognitive limitation and sociological constraints. It could give rise to a human-AI hybrid form of science that shall bring systems biology and other sciences into the next stage. The Nobel Turing Challenge aims to develop a highly autonomous AI system that can perform top-level science, indistinguishable from the quality of that performed by the best human scientists, where some of the discoveries may be worthy of Nobel Prize level recognition and beyond.},

We then show a general result that implies that no binary grammar can generate a unique stable assembly. We conclude the paper with a discussion of how graph grammars can be used to direct the synthesis of parts floating in a fluid or for self-motive robotic parts.},

  publisher = {Addison-Wesley Professional},
  abstract = {Software practitioners are rapidly discovering the immense value of Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) in solving problems within clearly definable problem domains. Developers are applying DSLs to improve productivity and quality in a wide range of areas, such as finance, combat simulation, macro scripting, image generation, and more. But until now, there have been few practical resources that explain how DSLs work and how to construct them for optimal use. Software Language Engineering fills that need. Written by expert DSL consultant Anneke Kleppe, this is the first comprehensive guide to successful DSL design. Kleppe systematically introduces and explains every ingredient of an effective language specification, including its description of concepts, how those concepts are denoted, and what those concepts mean in relation to the problem domain. Kleppe carefully illuminates good design strategy, showing how to maximize the flexibility of the languages you create. She also demonstrates powerful techniques for creating new DSLs that cooperate well with general-purpose languages and leverage their power. Completely tool-independent, this book can serve as the primary resource for readers using Microsoft DSL tools, the Eclipse Modeling Framework, openArchitectureWare, or any other DSL toolset. It contains multiple examples, an illustrative running case study, and insights and background information drawn from Kleppes leading-edge work as a DSL researcher. Specific topics covered include Discovering the types of problems that DSLs can solve, and when to use them Comparing DSLs with general-purpose languages, frameworks, APIs, and other approaches Understanding the roles and tools available to language users and engineers Creating each component of a DSL specification Modeling both concrete and abstract syntax Understanding and describing language semantics Defining textual and visual languages based on object-oriented metamodeling and graph transformations Using metamodels and associated tools to generate grammars Integrating object-oriented modeling with graph theory Building code generators for new languages Supporting multilanguage models and programs This book provides software engineers with all the guidance they need to create DSLs that solve real problems more rapidly, and with higher-quality code.},

  abstract = {The present study investigated the influence of experimentally induced emotions (positive, neutral, negative) on learning with multimedia instruction with N = 75 university students. In order to provide sound explanations about how emotional state might impact learning, measures of motivation, cognitive load, and attentional processes (eye tracking) were integrated. Results showed that while emotions did not influence retention, emotions did influence outcomes of the comprehension and transfer test. Specifically, a facilitating effect of an induced negative emotional state on learning outcomes was observed, which could be attributed to a more focused and detailed information processing. In contrast, an induced positive emotional state had a suppressing effect on learning outcomes since learners were distracted from the learning materials by their emotions. Motivational measures were not influenced by learners' different emotional states, but overall, controlled motivation increased and autonomous motivation decreased during learning. In sum, the learners' emotional state should be considered in learning research as an important predictor for learning success. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

As the number of types of IoT devices has grown exponentially, many kinds of insecure operating systems and open source software programs are being used. As they run with security vulnerabilities, IoT devices using such OS and software can be targeted by malicious attackers. In addition, due to the operating characteristics of IoT devices, it is difficult to apply security patches immediately when vulnerabilities are found. Accordingly, there is an increasing need for managing and sharing cyber security threat information in order to prevent security threats and accidents. This paper suggests a platform structure and application method for collecting, analyzing and sharing vulnerability information about IoT devices.},

The self-organizing map algorithm (an algorithm which order responses spatially) is reviewed, focusing on best matching cell selection and adaptation of the weight vectors. Suggestions for applying the self-organizing map algorithm, demonstrations of the ordering process, and an example of hierarchical clustering of data are presented. Fine tuning the map by learning vector quantization is addressed. The use of self-organized maps in practical speech recognition and a simulation experiment on semantic mapping are discussed},

Many researchers developed gamification frameworks and tools to ensure a purposeful gamification, but these theoretical frameworks are used by less than half of gamification research. There are numerous gamification frameworks and it is difficult to find a specific one. Our research aims to tackle this problem by providing a fast and easy process, that allows finding a gamification framework for a specific use case. We want to achieve this, by identifying selection and quality criteria and developing a method to match these criteria to a gamification framework. Succeeding this we will develop a tool, that allows the user to identify the most suited gamification frameworks for any combination of the selection criteria.},

  abstract = {In today's world, technology has become deep-rooted and more accessible than ever over a plethora of different devices and platforms, ranging from company servers and commodity PCs to mobile phones and wearables, interconnecting a wide range of stakeholders such as households, organizations and critical infrastructures. The sheer volume and variety of the different operating systems, the device particularities, the various usage domains and the accessibility-ready nature of the platforms creates a vast and complex threat landscape that is difficult to contain. Staying on top of these evolving cyber-threats has become an increasingly difficult task that presently relies heavily on collecting and utilising cyber-threat intelligence before an attack (or at least shortly after, to minimize the damage) and entails the collection, analysis, leveraging and sharing of huge volumes of data. In this work, we put forward INTIME, a machine learning-based integrated framework that provides an holistic view in the cyber-threat intelligence process and allows security analysts to easily identify, collect, analyse, extract, integrate, and share cyber-threat intelligence from a wide variety of online sources including clear/deep/dark web sites, forums and marketplaces, popular social networks, trusted structured sources (e.g., known security databases), or other datastore types (e.g., pastebins). INTIME is a zero-administration, open-source, integrated framework that enables security analysts and security stakeholders to (i) easily deploy a wide variety of data acquisition services (such as focused web crawlers, site scrapers, domain downloaders, social media monitors), (ii) automatically rank the collected content according to its potential to contain useful intelligence, (iii) identify and extract cyber-threat intelligence and security artifacts via automated natural language understanding processes, (iv) leverage the identified intelligence to actionable items by semi-automatic entity disambiguation, linkage and correlation, and (v) manage, share or collaborate on the stored intelligence via open standards and intuitive tools. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first solution in the literature to provide an end-to-end cyber-threat intelligence management platform that is able to support the complete threat lifecycle via an integrated, simple-to-use, yet extensible framework.},

  abstract = {Sustainable mobility concepts are challenged to create a positive users' attitude and a high willingness-to-use to be adopted and survive on the market. Prospective users must not merely be informed about the service but become involved and feel affected. The contribution introduces a digital learning game, a so called serious game, to improve players' knowledge, attitude and willingness to use mobility on demand systems (MODS). The goal of an evaluation study in a high school (N = 71) was to compare the serious game and an online research according to the proposed effects on knowledge, attitude and usage intention. The study demonstrates that pupils' level of knowledge about the operational concepts of MODS increased after playing the game and the retention rate was higher. Playing the game furthermore resulted in a more positive appraisal of MODS concerning their usefulness. No significant effect of the serious game on the later usage behaviour was found. The paper points out the benefits of a gamified approach for introducing mobility services to prospective users and derives recommendations for the application of gamified approaches to facilitate the adoption of new technology or services.},

  abstract = {Abstract. The popularity of miniature wargames (MWGs) has recently been on the rise. We aimed to identify the personality characteristics of people who play MWGs. Whereas the popular media have suspected that fantasy role-playing and war-related games cause antisocial behavior, past research on tabletop role-playing has shown that gamers are creative and empathetic individuals. Previous studies have investigated pen-and-paper tabletop games, which require imagination and cooperation between players. Tabletop MWGs are somewhat different because players compete against each other, and there is a strong focus on war-related actions. Thus, people have voiced the suspicion that players of this type of game may be rather aggressive. In the present study, 250 male MWG players completed questionnaires on the Big Five, authoritarianism, risk-orientation, and motives as well as an intelligence test. The same measures were administered to non-gamers, tabletop role-playing gamers, and first-person shooter gamers. Results indicated that according to self-reports, MWG players are more open, more extraverted, and have a higher need for affiliation than non-gamers. Further, high scores on reasoning and low scores on authoritarianism were typical of MWG players, and MWG players were similar to other gamers on these characteristics. All in all, our findings show that despite their penchant for (re)-enacting war scenes, MWG players seem to be open, nonauthoritarian individuals. Future research may add to these findings by using observer reports and longitudinal research to better understand whether intelligent and nontraditional people are attracted to MWGs or whether the setting of MWGs supports the development of such traits.},

In this paper, we present our approach to tackle the problem. Our agent, named Golovin, takes advantage of the limited game domain. We use genre-related corpora (including fantasy books and decompiled games) to create language models suitable to this domain. Moreover, we embed mechanisms that allow us to specify, and separately handle, important tasks as fighting opponents, managing inventory, and navigating on the game map. We validated usefulness of these mechanisms, measuring agent's performance on the set of 50 interactive fiction games. Finally, we show that our agent plays on a level comparable to the winner of the last year Text-Based Adventure AI Competition.},

Cooperation must be planned for and achieved through communication and negotiation. We present a logical model of the mental states of the agents based on a representation of their beliefs, desires, intentions, and goals. We present argumentation as an iterative process emerging from exchanges among agents to persuade each other and bring about a change in intentions. We look at argumentation as a mechanism for achieving cooperation and agreements. Using categories identified from human multi-agent negotiation, we demonstrate how the logic can be used to specify argument formulation and evaluation. We also illustrate how the developed logic can be used to describe different types of agents. Furthermore, we present a general Automated Negotiation Agent which we implemented, based on the logical model. Using this system, a user can analyze and explore different methods to negotiate and argue in a noncooperative environment where no centralized mechanism for coordination exists. The development of negotiating agents in the framework of the Automated Negotiation Agent is illustrated with an example where the agents plan, act, and resolve conflicts via negotiation in a Blocks World environment.},

  abstract = {From computer games to human societies, many natural and artificial phenomena can be represented as multi-agent systems. Over time, these systems have been proven a really powerful tool for modelling and understanding phenomena in fields, such as economics and trading, health care, urban planning and social sciences. However, although, intelligent agents have been around for years, their actual implementation is still in its early stages. Since the late nineties many agent platforms have been developed. Some of them have already been abandoned whereas others continue releasing new versions. On the other hand, the agent-oriented research community is still providing more and more new platforms. This vast amount of platform options leads to a high degree of heterogeneity. Hence, a common problem is how people interested in using multi-agent systems should choose which platform to use in order to benefit from agent technology. This decision was usually left to word of mouth, past experiences or platform publicity, lately however people depend on solid survey articles. To date, in most cases multi-agent system surveys describe only the basic characteristics of a few representatives without even providing any classification of the systems themselves. This article presents a comparative up-to-date review of the most promising existing agent platforms that can be used. It is based on universal comparison and evaluation criteria, proposing classifications for helping readers to understand which agent platforms broadly exhibit similar properties and in which situations which choices should be made.},

The approach is implemented through the Synesketch software system. Synesketch is published as a free, open source software library. Several Synesketch-based applications presented in the paper, such as the the emotional visual chat, stress the practical value of the approach.

The objective is to achieve a desired density distribution over a simply-connected spatial domain. Since individual agents in a swarm are not themselves of interest and we are concerned only with the macroscopic objective, we view the network of agents in the swarm as a discrete approximation of a continuous medium and design control laws to shape the density distribution of the continuous medium. The key feature of this work is that the agents in the swarm do not have access to position information. Each individual agent is capable of measuring the current local density of agents and can communicate with its spatial neighbors. The network of agents implement a Laplacian-based distributed algorithm, which we call pseudo-localization, to localize themselves in a new coordinate frame, and a distributed control law to converge to the desired spatial density distribution. We start by studying self-organization in one-dimension, which is then followed by the two-dimensional case.},

  abstract = {This paper, for the first time, presents comparable projections of travel behaviour impacts of the introduction of autonomous vehicles (AVs) into the private car fleet for two countries, namely the USA and Germany. The focus is on fully autonomous vehicles (AVs) which allow drivers to engage in other activities enroute. Two 2035 scenarios -- a trend scenario and an extreme scenario --are presented for both study countries. For these projections, we combine a vehicle technology diffusion model and an aspatial travel demand model. Factors that influence AV impact in the behavioural model are mainly new automobile user groups, e.g. travellers with mobility impairments, and altered generalized costs of travel, e.g. due to a lower value of travel time savings for car travel. The results indicate that AV penetrations rates might be higher in Germany (10\% or 38\% respectively) than in the USA (8\% or 29\% respectively) due to a higher share of luxury cars and quicker fleet turnover. On the contrary, the increase of vehicle mileage induced by AVs is not higher in Germany (+2.4\% or +8.6\% respectively) than in the USA (+3.4\% or +8.6\% respectively). This is mainly due to the lack of mode alternatives and lower fuel costs resulting in a higher share of travel times among the total generalized costs of travel in the USA. These results clearly indicate that context factors shaped by national policy will influence AV adoption and impact on travel demand changes. Based on these results the paper draws policy recommendations which will help to harness the advantages of AVs while avoiding their negative consequences.},

A metamodeling framework suitable for MDA is constructed step-by-step and then used to explain and critique the OMG's various metamodeling technologies. This information furnishes modelers with the heuristics they need to more effectively utilize OMG metamodeling technology and to know when metamodeling concepts are suitable and when they are not. The paper ends with some methodological advice on how to model in the presence of more than two modeling levels (objects and classes).},

Our algorithm distinguishes between low- and high-level communication tasks so that ACMICS can be easily extended and employed in new simulation scenarios.

Observations from the examples were synthesized to yield an overview of contemporary directions for the perceived role of Artificial Intelligence in telehealth. ,  Results : Two major focus areas for related contemporary directions were established. These were first, quality improvement for existing clinical practice and service delivery, and second, the development and support of new models of care. Case studies from each focus area have been chosen for illustration purposes. ,  Conclusion : Examples of the role of Artificial Intelligence in delivery of health care remotely include use of tele-assessment, tele-diagnosis, tele-interactions, and tele-monitoring. Further developments of underlying algorithms and validation of methods will be required for wider adoption.

Data from three focus groups of undergraduate and graduate students was analyzed using Thematic Collation and Thematic Analysis to illuminate how students evaluate their satisfaction with online classes. Student satisfaction with online learning emerged as a lived consonance, that is a ``gearing together'' of student concerns. The main dimensions of these concerns are student expectations regarding the time and space of online learning, self-motivation, and the role of others, including fellow students and the teacher. Ultimately, student satisfaction depends on the convergence of the student's expectations regarding these dimensions with the student's overarching educational and life goals for taking the course.},

Once elaborated, these different diagrams undergo a validation to assure inter-and intra model coherence. The formal and object oriented language RT-Maude, base on rewriting logic, supports formal specification and programming of concurrent systems. The main motivations of this work are: (1) formalizing the organizational requirements of RT-MAS by using RT-Maude language, and (2) integrating the validation of the coherence models, since the analysis phase.},

  abstract = {In this research, we develop a research model explaining the adoption of conversational agents for disease diagnosis. Healthcare is challenged by a parallel increasing demand for healthcare services and a decreasing supply of healthcare professionals. Mobile Health is proposed to overcome geographical, temporal, and organizational barriers of healthcare services. Conversational agents (CA), i.e. software programs that interact with users through natural language, are developed that are even able to diagnose a disease based on an individuals' input using a chat interface. However, these systems face an adoption challenge. To understand that, we use UTAUT2 as theoretical lens and 35 semi-structured interviews with potential users of a CA for disease diagnosis. Based on that we propose a research model that contains (1) well-known UTAUT2 factors (performance and effort expectancy, facilitating conditions), (2) re-defined other factors to better fit the context (social influence, price value, habit), and (3) newly identified ones (privacy risk expectancy, trust in provider and system, compatibility, experience in e-diagnosis, access to health system). We also reveal that hedonic motivation is not relevant for CA adoption. The newly proposed model addresses research gaps in CA research in general, but also in mHealth and especially the use of CA in healthcare research in particular. We also discuss rather general implications for technology acceptance research and provide some suggestions for providers of CA in healthcare to increase the diffusion rates of these systems.},

Competitive programming motivates student learning by allowing students to evaluate and improve their programs throughout an assignment by competing their code against instructor-defined code and the code of other students in a tournament environment. Pedagogical results indicate that the combination of game development and friendly student competition is a significant motivator for increased student performance.},

Well substantiated cases of social learning among the insects include learning about predation threat and floral rewards, the transfer of route information using a symbolic 'language' (the honeybee dance) and the rapid spread of chemosensory preferences through honeybee colonies via classical conditioning procedures. More controversial examples include the acquisition of motor memories by observation, teaching in ants and behavioural traditions in honeybees. In many cases, simple mechanistic explanations can de identified for such complex behaviour patterns. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In this paper, we report on an empirical experiment in which human subjects have invented short plots in a constrained scenario. The stories were annotated according to features commonly found in existing automatic story generators. The annotation was designed to measure the proportion and relations of story components that should be used in automatic computational systems for matching human behaviour. Results suggest that there are relatively common patterns that can be used as input data for identifying similarity to human-invented stories in automatic storytelling systems. The found patterns are in line with narratological models, and the results provide numerical quantification and layout of story components. The proposed method of story analysis is tested over two additional sources, the ROCStories corpus and stories generated by automated storytellers, to illustrate the valuable insights that may be derived from them.},

In this paper, we discuss the evolution of this framework which has been motivated by its use in a number of applications, including: information gathering and management, intelligent home automation, distributed situation assessment, coordination of concurrent engineering activities, hospital scheduling, travel planning, repair service coordination and supply chain management. First, we review the basic architecture of GPGP and then present extensions to the T\AE MS domain-independent representation of agent activities. We next describe extensions to GPGP that permit the representation of situation-specific coordination strategies and social laws as well as making possible the use of GPGP in large agent organizations. Additionally, we discuss a more encompassing view of commitments that takes into account uncertainty in commitments. We then present new coordination mechanisms for use in resource sharing and contracting, and more complex coordination mechanisms that use a cooperative search among agents to find appropriate commitments. We conclude with a summary of the major ideas underpinning GPGP, an analysis of the applicability of the GPGP framework including performance issues, and a discussion of future research directions.},

This not only adverse selection problems, but also moral hazards in which hidden actions generate private information over future. In this paper we show, in the context of a multiperiod-agent relationship with adverse selection, that renegotiable-term contracts can be as efficient as long-term renegotiation-proof. On the other hand, spot contracting may fail to achieve-run efficiency not only because of intertemporal smoothing, with symmetric information, but also because of ratchet effects time inconsistency in the optimal structure of informational. Thus some limited commitment seems to be a necessary and sufficient to achieve long-run efficiency.},

  abstract = {In this paper we argue for using a " Game First " approach to teaching introductory programming. We believe that concerns over whether an OO approach or a procedural approach should be used first are secondary to the course assignment and example content. If examples are not compelling, student interests often lags thus making the OO versus procedural argument moot. We believe that game programming motivates most new programmers. Compelling assignments mean that students are far more likely to learn because they are interested, and the visual component allows students to see mistakes in their code as manifested in the resultant graphics. We describe our experiences after redesigning and offering a new introductory computer science sequence using 2D game development as a unifying theme. We teach fundamental programming concepts via two dimensional game development in Flash and ActionScript during the first quarter, transition to C++ to solidify concepts and add pointers during the second quarter, then teach a multi-phase project based game approach using C++ and openGL (2D graphics only) during the third quarter. Our surveys show that this approach improved student understanding of all seven basic topics examined.},

  abstract = {As they are maturing--i.e., as they are becoming validated, calibrated and refined--computational emulation models of organizations are evolving into: powerful new kinds of organizational design tools for predicting and mitigating organizational risks; and flexible new kinds of organizational theorem-provers for validating extant organization theory and developing new theory. Over the past 50 years, computational modeling and simulation have had enormous impacts on the rate of advancement of knowledge in fields like physics, chemistry and, more recently, biology; and their subsequent application has enabled whole new areas of engineering practice. In the same way, as our young discipline comes of age, computational organizational models are beginning to impact behavioral, organizational and economic science, and management consulting practice. This paper attempts to draw parallels between computational modeling in natural sciences and computational modeling of organizations as a contributor to both social science and management practice. To illustrate the lifecycle of a computational organizational model that is now relatively mature, this paper traces the evolution of the Virtual Design Team (VDT) computational modeling and simulation research project at Stanford University from its origins in 1988 to the present. It lays out the steps in the process of validating VDT as a "computational emulation" model of organizations to the point that VDT began to influence management practice and, subsequently, to advance organizational science. We discuss alternate research trajectories that can be taken by computational and mathematical modelers who prefer the typical natural science validation trajectory--i.e., who attempt to impact organizational science first and, perhaps subsequently, to impact management practice. The paper concludes with a discussion of the current state-of-the-art of computational modeling of organizations and some thoughts about where, and how rapidly, the field is headed.

  abstract = {Self-organization has been proposed to be implemented in complex systems which require the automation capabilities to govern itself and to adapt upon changes. Self-organizing systems can be modeled as multi-agent systems (MAS) since they share common characteristics in that they consist of multiple autonomous systems. However, most existing MAS engineering methodologies do not fully support self-organizing systems design since they require predefined goals and agent behaviors, which is not the case in self-organizing systems. Another feature that is currently not supported for designing self-organizing MAS is the separation between the design of agent behaviors and behavior adaptation, i.e. how agents adapt their behaviors to respond upon changes. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a role modeling method, in which agent behaviors are represented as roles, to design how agents perform behavior adaptation at runtime by switching between roles. The applicability of the proposed role modeling method is evaluated in a case study of a self-organizing smart transportation system.},

  abstract = {Despite huge investment of information and communication technology (ICT) in schools across the world, recent studies showed its non-positive association with academic achievement. While educators or policymakers may doubt the contribution of ICT in education, few studies examined the indirect effect of ICT use on academic achievement via ICT-related dispositions, such as students' perceived autonomy, competence, and interest in ICT (cognitive-motivational engagement in ICT). Guided by self-determination theory (SDT) and related literature, we hypothesized a three-level structural equation model to examine the interplay between ICT use, cognitivemotivational engagement in ICT, and academic achievement based on 15-year-old secondary students from 52 countries in the PISA 2018. The results showed cognitive-motivational engagement in ICT exerted a positive mediating effect between ICT use and academic achieve\- ment at the student and school levels, indicating ICT use exerted an indirect positive effect on academic achievement, and satisfaction of students' basic psychological needs in a specific area such as ICT is likely to promote their optimal functioning in other areas such as learning. Hence, students should be provided more opportunities to orchestrate technologies in formal and informal contexts helps develop their self-determination, discernment, and self-regulation in ICT use, and thereby creating the conditions in which better learning outcomes are more likely to occur. These findings also deepen our understanding of SDT and provide a guiding framework for educators to design pedagogies that can better address students' ICT-related psychological needs. Finally, this study shows that a quadratic term should be modeled when examining the rela\- tionship between ICT use and academic achievement.},

  abstract = {The low access rate to resources and learner diversity of massive open online courses (MOOCs) has led to a shift in MOOC resource design toward how to better support adaptive learning through personalized recommendation, highlighting the importance of exploring diversified ac\- cess paths for MOOC resources and their dynamics. Nevertheless, most studies have explored the MOOC learning process from the perspective of behavior sequences or activity distributions, thus limiting the ability to reveal the diversified paths learners use to access MOOC resources. From a perspective of network analysis, this study used log data generated by 12,468 participants from a Chinese MOOC to build resource access networks of learners with resources as nodes. This data was then used to investigate learners' diversified paths to access content-related resources by examining the structure and dynamics of the networks. Learners with different engagement and achievement levels differ in chapter access paths, specific resource access paths, and the dynamic characteristics of their access behavior patterns. Compared with the scattered, localized, and short access paths of the subpopulations not taking the exam, the final exam-taker subpopulations showed coherent, expanded and long access paths across all chapters and tended to use quizzes as scaffolding for other resources within and across chapters. Notably, successful learners showed a trend of reciprocity in resource access early in the course, an important feature that distinguished them from the other subpopulations. The findings inform the design of personalized resource recommendation systems for adaptive learning in MOOCs.},

  abstract = {Agents can learn to improve their coordination with their teammates and increase team performance. There are finite training instances, where each training instance is an opportunity for the learning agents to improve their coordination. In this article, we focus on allocating training instances to learning agent pairs, i.e., pairs that improve coordination with each other, with the goal of team formation. Agents learn at different rates, and hence, the allocation of training instances affects the performance of the team formed. We build upon previous work on the Synergy Graph model, that is learned completely from data and represents agents' capabilities and compatibility in a multi-agent team. We formally define the learning agents team formation problem, and compare it with the multi-armed bandit problem. We consider learning agent pairs that improve linearly and geometrically, i.e., the marginal improvement decreases by a constant factor. We contribute algorithms that allocate the training instances, and compare against algorithms from the multi-armed bandit problem. In our simulations, we demonstrate that our algorithms perform similarly to the bandit algorithms in the linear case, and outperform them in the geometric case. Further, we apply our model and algorithms to a multi-agent foraging problem, thus demonstrating the efficacy of our algorithms in general multi-agent problems.},

Multiplayer online games, now often integrated with social networks, provide social contexts in which player-to-player interactions take place, for example, through the trading of virtual items between players. Building upon a theoretical framework based in computer science and cognitive science, we present results from a novel approach to modeling and analyzing player values in terms of both preferences made in avatar customization, and patterns in social networking use. Our approach resulted in the development of the Steam-Player-Preference Analyzer (Steam-PPA) system, which (1) performs advanced data collection on publicly available social networking profile information and (2) the AIR Toolkit Status Performance Classifier (AIR-SPC), which uses machine learning techniques including clustering, natural language processing, and support vector machines (SVM) to perform inference on the data. As an initial case-study, we apply both systems to the popular, and commercially successful, multi-player first-person-shooter game Team Fortress 2 by analyzing information from player accounts on the social network Steam, together with avatar customization information generated by the player within the game. Our model uses social networking information to predict the likelihood of players customizing their profile in several ways associated with the monetary values of the players' avatar.},

The proposed multi-directional backlight system is based on the Bragg mismatched reconstruction of volume holographic optical element (VHOE), and includes a set of light sources which are uniformly arrayed along one direction. Each light source produces its corresponding directional lighting to follow the human eye position detected by an eye tracker. Two scenarios are presented to build the multi-directional backlight system. The prism-type backlight system which guides the incident beam with a prism is relatively simple and easy to implement. The waveguide-type one which employs a transflective film to expand the incident light beam within the waveguide and modulate the intensity of the incident beam, is relatively thin and is applicable to large-area display. Two prototypes are built and the effectiveness of the proposed autostereoscopic display system is verified by the experimental results.},

In this paper, we present Meltdown. Meltdown exploits side effects of out-of-order execution on modern processors to read arbitrary kernel-memory locations including personal data and passwords. Out-of-order execution is an indispensable performance feature and present in a wide range of modern processors. The attack is independent of the operating system, and it does not rely on any software vulnerabilities. Meltdown breaks all security guarantees provided by address space isolation as well as paravirtualized environments and, thus, every security mechanism building upon this foundation. On affected systems, Meltdown enables an adversary to read memory of other processes or virtual machines in the cloud without any permissions or privileges, affecting millions of customers and virtually every user of a personal computer. We show that the KAISER defense mechanism for KASLR has the important (but inadvertent) side effect of impeding Meltdown. We stress that KAISER must be deployed immediately to prevent largescale exploitation of this severe information leakage.},

However, the challenges are still open for mobile users to receive computation from the cloud with satisfied quality-of-service (QoS) provisioning. In this paper, we study computation offloading by using edge computing, which is a new paradigm to deliver computation to the edge of pervasive networks nearby mobile users. Without strong incentive in place, however, local edge servers may be reluctant to help offload computation. To stimulate cloud service operator and local edge server owners to participate in computation offloading, we formulate the interactions among cloud service operator and edge server owners as a Stackelberg game to maximize the utilities of cloud service operator and edge server owners by obtaining the optimal payment and computation offloading strategies. Through theoretical analysis, we show that the game is guaranteed to reach a unique Nash equilibrium. We then design two computation offloading algorithms that can quantify their efficiencies in terms of low delay and reduced complexity. Additionally, we extend our work by considering that edge server owners dynamically join or leave computation offloading. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithms perform well in computation offloading and efficiently stimulate edge server owners to make contribution to computation offloading.},

Excitement surrounding gamification results from its many potential organizational benefits. However, few research and design guidelines exist regarding gamified information systems. We therefore write this commentary to call upon information systems scholars to investigate the design and use of gamified information systems from a variety of disciplinary perspectives and theories, including behavioral economics, psychology, social psychology, information systems, etc. We first explicate the idea of gamified information systems, provide real-world examples of successful and unsuccessful systems, and, based on a synthesis of the available literature, present a taxonomy of gamification design elements. We then develop a framework for research and design: its main theme is to create meaningful engagement for users; that is, gamified information systems should be designed to address the dual goals of instrumental and experiential outcomes. Using this framework, we develop a set of design principles and research questions, using a running case to illustrate some of our ideas. We conclude with a summary of opportunities for IS researchers to extend our knowledge of gamified information systems, and, at the same time, advance existing theories.},

  abstract = {Device-to-device (D2D) is a new paradigm in cellular networks that enhances network performance by introducing increased spectral efficiency and reduced communication delay. Efficient data dissemination is indispensable for supporting many D2D applications such as content distribution and locationaware advertisement. In this work, we investigate a new and interesting data dissemination problem where the receivers are not explicitly known and data must be disseminated to the receivers within a probabilistic delay budget. We propose to exploit data depositories, which can temporarily house data and deliver them to interested receivers upon requests. We formally formulate the delay-constrained profit maximization problem for data deposition in D2D networks and show its NP-hardness. Under the unique mobile opportunistic network setting, a practical solution must be distributed, localized, and online. To this end, we introduce three algorithms for Direct Online Selection of 1-Depository, Direct Online Selection of LDepositories, and Mixed Online Selection of L-Depositories. To demonstrate and evaluate the system, we implement a prototype using Google Nexus handsets and conduct experiments for five weeks. We further carry out simulations based on real-world mobility traces for evaluation of large-scale networks and various network settings that are impractical to experiment.},

  abstract = {It is a significant challenge for Device-to-Device (D2D) networks to deliver mobile videos among mobile users due to the highly nondeterministic and intermittent connectivity. In this paper, we propose to integrate the random mobility of users in mobile opportunistic D2D networks with crowdsourcing to push mobile video Ads. Incentives are key to the success of video Ads push as it heavily depends on how actively mobile users participate in it. To stimulate users to perform mobile video Ads push tasks, we model the interaction between depositories and the Ad provider as a reverse auction. More specifically, we try to maximize the utility of Ad provider by selecting a subset of depositories before a specified deadline. We first propose an online auction algorithm, OA, which runs efficiently in polynomial time, guarantees individual rationality, profitability. However, it does not guarantee truthfulness and thus limits its practicality. We then introduce two truthful online auction algorithms, i.e., TOA and TOA-MM. We carry out trace-driven simulation to verify the three online auction algorithms. The simulation results corroborate that the proposed algorithms have superior performance and efficiently stimulate mobile users to make contribution to video Ads push.},

  abstract = {Procedural content generation in video games has a long history. Existing procedural content generation methods, such as search-based, solver-based, rule-based and grammar-based methods have been applied to various content types such as levels, maps, character models, and textures. A research field centered on content generation in games has existed for more than a decade. More recently, deep learning has powered a remarkable range of inventions in content production, which are applicable to games. While some cutting-edge deep learning methods are applied on their own, others are applied in combination with more traditional methods, or in an interactive setting. This article surveys the various deep learning methods that have been applied to generate game content directly or indirectly, discusses deep learning methods that could be used for content generation purposes but are rarely used today, and envisages some limitations and potential future directions of deep learning for procedural content generation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Engagement in online programs is difficult to maintain. Gamification is the recent trend that offers to increase engagement through the inclusion of game-like features like points and badges, in non-game contexts. This review will answer the following question, 'Are gamification strategies effective in increasing engagement in online programs?' METHOD: Eight databases (Web of Science, PsycINFO, Medline, INSPEC, ERIC, Cochrane Library, Business Source Complete and ACM Digital Library) were searched from 2010 to the 28th of October 2015 using a comprehensive search strategy. Eligibility criteria was based on the PICOS format, where "population" included adults, "intervention" involved an online program or smart phone application that included at least one gamification feature. "Comparator" was a control group, "outcomes" included engagement and "downstream" outcomes which occurred as a result of engagement; and "study design" included experimental studies from peer-reviewed sources. Effect sizes (Cohens d and 95\% confidence intervals) were also calculated. RESULTS: 1017 studies were identified from database searches following the removal of duplicates, of which 15 met the inclusion criteria. The studies involved a total of 10,499 participants, and were commonly undertaken in tertiary education contexts. Engagement metrics included time spent (n = 5), volume of contributions (n = 11) and occasions visited to the software (n = 4); as well as downstream behaviours such as performance (n = 4) and healthy behaviours (n = 1). Effect sizes typically ranged from medium to large in direct engagement and downstream behaviours, with 12 out of 15 studies finding positive significant effects in favour of gamification. CONCLUSION: Gamification is effective in increasing engagement in online programs. Key recommendations for future research into gamification are provided. In particular, rigorous study designs are required to fully examine gamification's effects and determine how to best achieve sustained engagement.},

Following the theory of thick description we extend the generative paradigm to interpretative research in cultural studies. Using the example of qualitative data about criminal culture, the paper describes a research process that facilitates interpretative research by growing virtual cultures. Relying on qualitative data for the development of agent rules, the research process combines several steps: Qualitative data analysis following the Grounded Theory paradigm enables concept identification, resulting in the development of a conceptual model of the concept relations. The so ware tool CCD is used in conceptual modelling which assists semi-automatic transformation in a simulation model developed in the simulation platform DRAMS. Both tools preserve traceability to the empirical evidence throughout the research process. Traceability enables interpretation of simulations by generating a narrative storyline of the simulation. Thereby simulation enables a qualitative exploration of textual data. The whole process generates a thick description of the subject of study, in our example criminal culture. The simulation is characterized by a socio-cognitive coupling of agents' reasoning on the state of the mind of other agents. This reveals a thick description of how participants make sense of the phenomenology of a situation from the perspective of their world-view.},

While the game world and the available actions therein are inspired by their offline counterparts, the games' popularity and dedicated fan base are testaments to the allure of novel social interactions granted to people by allowing them an alternative life as a new character and persona. In this paper we investigate the phenomenon of "gender swapping," which refers to players choosing avatars of genders opposite to their natural ones. We report the behavioral patterns observed in players of Fairyland Online, a globally serviced MMORPG, during social interactions when playing as in-game avatars of their own real gender or gender-swapped. We also discuss the effect of gender role and self-image in virtual social situations and the potential of our study for improving MMORPG quality and detecting online identity frauds.},

  abstract = {In this paper, the development of an assistance system for the elderly that combines robots with a network of sensors and actuators is described. The architecture was developed with the aim of interaction. With this reason, the system incorporates particular solutions that are adaptable to the needs of the user, such as a pyramid interaction system, a telepresence robot, a biometric bracelet, and others. In the software, the system is composed of two servers: local and web. The local server is in charge of different modules that interact with direct users and their needs. The web server provides different facilities to external users to access the system remotely. A use case is analyzed where the proposed system is validated.},

Since this process varies among individuals and since similar ideas are therefore relayed at different levels of specificity and by means of different words, the problem of literature searching by machines still presents major difficulties. A statistical approach to this problem will be outlined and the various steps of a system based on this approach will be described. Steps include the statistical analysis of a collection of documents in a field of interest, the establishment of a set of "notions" and the vocabulary by which they are expressed, the compilation of a thesaurus-type dictionary and index, the automatic encoding of documents by machine with the aid of such a dictionary, the encoding of topological notations (such as branched structures), the recording of the coded information, the establishment of a searching pattern for finding pertinent information, and the programming of appropriate machines to carry out a search.},

  abstract = {Gamification refers to the use of game-design elements or mechanisms in nongame contexts to promote the expected behaviours. Though theoretically promising, empirical studies reported mixed results as to the effectiveness of gamification in educational practices. To understand this issue better, this author selected 44 articles on the topic of educational gamification with the use of a bibliometric analysis software HistCite, followed by a descriptive content analysis on these articles. This author examined three issues, including how effective the educational gamification implementations were in previous empirical studies, how the effectiveness has been measured, and what factors contribute to varied effectiveness results. One significant output of the current study is the redefinition of two terms: game elements refer to ``the obvious game-like elements that are frequently used in digital games or gamification, which are concrete nouns'', and gamification mechanisms refer to ``the underlying guidelines that make gamification activities engaging, which are abstract nouns that relate to humans' innate psychological needs''. What's more, the content analysis helped summarise a framework describing what makes gamification engaging, which contains goal, visualisation, immediate feedback, adaptation, challenge, competition, reward, and fun failure. Limitations and suggestions for future studies have been discussed.},

  abstract = {Cloud gaming, wherein game graphics is rendered in the cloud and streamed back to the user as real-time video, expands the gaming market to billions of users who do not have gaming consoles or high-power graphics PCs. Companies like Nvidia, Amazon, Sony and Microsoft are investing in building cloud gaming platforms to tap this large unserved market. However, cloud gaming requires the user to have high-bandwidth and stable network connectivity -- whereas a typical con- sole game needs about 100--200 kbps, a cloud game demands minimum 10--20 Mbps. This makes the Internet Service Provider (ISP) a key player in ensuring the end-user's good gaming experience. In this paper we develop a method to detect Nvidia's GeForce NOW cloud gaming sessions over their network infrastructure, and measure associated user experience. In particular, we envision ISPs taking advan- tage of our method to provision network capacity at the right time and in the right place to support growth in cloud gaming at the right expe- rience level; as well as identify the role of contextual factors such as user setup (browser vs app) and connectivity type (wired vs wireless) in performance degradation. We first present a detailed anatomy of flow establishment and volumetric profiles of cloud gaming sessions over mul- tiple platforms, followed by a method to detect gameplay and measure key experience aspects such as latency, frame rate and resolution via real-time analysis of network traffic. The insights and methods are also validated in the lab for XBox Cloud Gaming platform. We then imple- ment and deploy our method in a campus network to capture gameplay behaviors and experience measures across various user setups and con- nectivity types which we believe are valuable for network operators.},

With increasing interests in applying simulation to complex manufacturing problems, regression metamodels can greatly reduce the cost, time, and the amount of effort spent in conducting simulation. These models can also be generalized within the bounds defined for the problem's parameters. The use of a regression metamodel to conduct sensitivity analysis, application in ``optimizing'' manufacturing systems, and the validity of the model are illustrated. An example is given with a maintenance float problem.}

  abstract = {Norms and normative multiagent systems have become the subjects of interest for many researchers. Such interest is caused by the need for agents to exploit the norms in enhancing their performance in a community. The term norm is used to characterize the behaviours of community members. The concept of normative multiagent systems is used to facilitate collaboration and coordination among social groups of agents. Many researches have been conducted on norms that investigate the fundamental concepts, definitions, classification, and types of norms and normative multiagent systems including normative architectures and normative processes. However, very few researches have been found to comprehensively study and analyze the literature in advancing the current state of norms and normative multiagent systems. Consequently, this paper attempts to present the current state of research on norms and normative multiagent systems and propose a norm's life cycle model based on the review of the literature. Subsequently, this paper highlights the significant areas for future work.},

We introduce progress reports and describe how these can be used as a tool to evaluate student learning and understanding during programming courses. Complemented with data from surveys and the exam, the progress reports can be used to build an overall picture of individual student progress in a course, and to answer questions related to how students (1) understand program code as a whole, (2) understand individual constructs, and (3) perceive the difficulty level of different programming topics. We also present results from using this approach in introductory programming courses at secondary level. Our initial experience from using the progress reports is positive, as they provide valuable information during the course, which most likely would remain uncovered otherwise. \copyright{} 2007 Institute of Mathematics and Informatics, Vilnius.},

  abstract = {Educational gamification consists of the use of game elements and game design techniques in the educational context. The objective of this study is to examine the existing evidence on the impact of educational gamification on student motivation and academic performance in the last five years in order to analyze its distribution over time, educational level, variables, and most used game elements, and know the advantages of its implementation in the classroom. For this, a systematic review is proposed through the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology in three multidisciplinary databases, through an exhaustive search with inclusion and exclusion criteria on quantitative experimental studies that explore gamification in educational centers, which provide information about the most current lines of research. Fourteen studies were included in this review. These used experimental or quasi-experimental designs. Most of them report gamification as a valid learning strategy. The results support the conclusion that educational gamification has a potential impact on the academic performance, commitment, and motivation of students. Therefore, this study implies the need to expand research on the needs and challenges of students when learning with gamified techniques.},

  abstract = {The use of technology for social connectivity and achieving engagement goals is increasingly essential to the overall well-being of our rapidly ageing population. While much of the extant literature has focused on home automation and indoor remote health monitoring; there is a growing literature that finds personal health and overall well-being improves when physical activities are conducted outdoors. This study presents a review of possible innovative and assistive eHealth technologies suitable for smart therapeutic and rehabilitation outdoor spaces for older persons. The article also presents key performance metrics required of eHealth technologies to ensure robust, timely and reliable biometric data transfer between patients in a therapeutic landscape environment and respective medical centres. A literature review of relevant publications with a primary focus of integrating sensors and eHealth technologies in outdoor spaces to collect and transfer data from the elderly demographic who engage such built landscapes to appropriate stakeholders was conducted. A content analysis was carried out to synthesize outcomes of the literature review. The study finds that research in assistive eHealth technologies and interfaces for outdoor therapeutic spaces is in its nascent stages and has limited generalisability. The level of technology uptake and readiness for smart outdoor spaces is still developing and is currently being outpaced by the growth of elderly fitness zones in public spaces. Further research is needed to explore those eHealth technologies with interactive feedback mechanisms that are suitable for outdoor therapeutic environments.},

  abstract = {Rural mobility has a lack of innovative proposals in contrast with its urban counterpart. This research aims to bring solutions that ease the implementation of reliable and flexible rural transportation. Demand-responsive transportation is chosen to develop a public transportation service providing interurban trips among several rural settlements. Given the characteristics of rural displacement demand, a novel approach is introduced to optimize the service's economic costs: the dynamic transfer point allocation. The problem is fully formulated and an architecture is introduced describing the workflow of the whole system. Data from an interurban bus transportation service are used to build a case study of a rural area of Valencia, Spain, and develop several examples illustrating the benefits of the proposed approach. The results reveal that the dynamic creation of transfer points can simplify the transportation fleet's itineraries and boost the amount of served travel requests. Finally, a discussion of the benefits and dangers of flexible features in rural transportation is developed, underscoring the need to achieve a balance between dynamic operation and service quality.},

  abstract = {Demand-responsive transportation systems deal with the challenge of creating dynamic routes to accommodate user displacement demand. Given a user request, its spatial and temporal constraints influence the ease of allocating it and, in turn, the cost involved to complete it. Aiming to ease request allocation and reduce system costs, we propose a gamification-based algorithm that optimises the solutions computed for a demand-responsive transportation system. The gamification system aims to group user demand spatially and temporally through a reward system. Users who issue particularly costly requests are presented with a modification of its constraints together with a reward that incentivises the modification's acceptance. In this paper, we formalise the problem, present the demand-grouping algorithm, and describe the user's interaction with the gamification system. A case study is developed to exemplify the use of the proposal and its cost optimisation potential.},

  abstract = {The major goal of the paper was to develop a theoretical framework that conceptualizes the indirect impact on human resource management practice on knowledge sharing in the organization. In the current competitive environment, the ability to use knowledge assets and to continuously renovate it is required for organizational success. Therefore, the field of human resource management should dedicate great effort to understanding how to enhance the knowledge flows within the organization. Theoretical indications were provided about HRM practices that influence the quality and quantity of knowledge sharing within an organization. Further, a conceptual model of relations between HRM practices and factors influencing knowledge sharing within an organization was introduced. It is supposed that HRM practices have direct impacts on personality traits of employees, organizational culture, characteristics of managers, and instruments used for knowledge sharing. Subsequently, these factors have direct effects on the perceived intensity of knowledge sharing. The paper offers 12 testable propositions for the indirect relation between HRM practices and knowledge sharing in the organization. The suggested model could assist future research to examine the influence of HRM practices upon managing knowledge is a more complex way. Via a theoretical contribution to the debate on the influence on HRM practices upon managing knowledge, the study contributes to further research development in this field.},

The Navy employs some 280 people, called detailers, full time to effect these new assignments. The intelligent distribution agent (IDA) prototype was designed and built to automate, in a cognitively plausible manner, the job of the human detailers. That model is being redesigned to function as a multi-agent system. This is not a trivial matter due to the fact that there would need to be approximately 350000 individual agents. There are also many issues relating to how the agents interact and how all entities involved, including humans, exercise their autonomy. This paper describes both the IDA prototype and the multi-agent IDA system being created from it. We also discuss several of the major issues regarding the design, interaction and autonomy of the various agents involved},

  abstract = {BackgroundArtificial intelligence (AI) is said to be ?transforming mental health?. AI-based technologies and technique are now considered to have uses in almost every domain of mental health care: including decision-making, assessment and healthcare management. What remains underexplored is whether/how mental health recovery is situated within these discussions and practices.MethodTaking conversational agents as our point of departure, we explore the ways official online materials explain and make sense of chatbots, their imagined functionality and value for (potential) users. We focus on three chatbots for mental health: Woebot, Wysa and Tess.Findings?Recovery? is largely missing as an overt focus across materials. However, analysis does reveal themes that speak to the struggles over practice, expertise and evidence that the concept of recovery articulates. We discuss these under the headings ?troubled clinical responsibility?, ?extended virtue of (technological) self-care? and ?altered ontologies and psychopathologies of time?.ConclusionsUltimately, we argue that alongside more traditional forms of recovery, chatbots may be shaped by, and shaping, an increasingly individualised form of a ?personal recovery imperative?.},

  abstract = {With the exception of the research on the expressions of emotions in a second language, the link between emotions and motivation has not received enough attention in the field of Second Language Acquisition (SLA). This article aims at reflecting on the relationship between emotions, motivation and the social context where these are experienced. It is argued that the effect of emotions on any language learning process is mediated by motivation levels, self-regulation and the social context where learning takes place. The study was carried out with a qualitative perspective using personal narratives, journals and semi-structured interviews. The results show seven different sources of motivation for students and, surprisingly, it seems to show that some students are able to turn negative emotions into motivational energy. Supportive interpersonal interactions - or the lack of these - in the social context seem to play a paramount role in managing emotions in a language learning setting. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

KGs surpass any other form of representation in terms of effectiveness. However, Knowledge Graph Engineering (KGE) requires in-depth experiences of graph structures, web technologies, existing models and vocabularies, rule sets, logic, as well as best practices. It also demands a significant amount of work. Considering the advancements in large language models (LLMs) and their interfaces and applications in recent years, we have conducted comprehensive experiments with ChatGPT to explore its potential in supporting KGE. In this paper, we present a selection of these experiments and their results to demonstrate how ChatGPT can assist us in the development and management of KGs.},

It also presents a comprehensive review of the literature in an attempt to answer the question regarding the elements: attributes and responsibilities of the CKO, and organisational conditions that contribute to the CKO success. Moreover, this paper highlights the role of the e\textregistered ective CKO in facilitating knowledge management (KM). Finally, this paper addresses the challenges that the CKO may encounter and forecasts what will be tomorrow's CKO. The approach of this paper is based on an intensive and comprehensive literature review that aim to study the CKO position and address di\textregistered erent aspects related to the real potential of the CKO's role that is, transforming intellectual capital into pro\textasciimacron t. An integrative conceptual research model is adopted and modi\textasciimacron ed to encompass the CKO attributes, responsibilities, and organisational conditions that contribute to the CKO success and his/her role in facilitating KM. Both quantitative and qualitative studies that addressed related aspect to CKO have been reviewed. From these studies it can be concluded that the primary role of the CKO is to convert knowledge into pro\textasciimacron t by leveraging the organisation's intellectual assets through facilitating KM. This study is probably one of the \textasciimacron rst studies to introduce a research model that delineates and integrates multiple issues that contribute to the success of the CKO and comprehensively present a detailed literature about this position. The \textasciimacron ndings of this paper have impli-cations for both academicians and organisational executives.},

  abstract = {The recently introduced continuous Skip-gram model is an efficient method for learning high-quality distributed vector representations that capture a large number of precise syntactic and semantic word relationships. In this paper we present several extensions that improve both the quality of the vectors and the training speed. By subsampling of the frequent words we obtain significant speedup and also learn more regular word representations. We also describe a simple alternative to the hierarchical softmax called negative sampling. An inherent limitation of word representations is their indifference to word order and their inability to represent idiomatic phrases. For example, the meanings of "Canada" and "Air" cannot be easily combined to obtain "Air Canada". Motivated by this example, we present a simple method for finding phrases in text, and show that learning good vector representations for millions of phrases is possible.},

Many knowledge organization systems, such as thesauri, taxonomies, classification schemes and subject heading systems, share a similar structure, and are used in similar applications. SKOS captures much of this similarity and makes it explicit, to enable data and technology sharing across diverse applications. The SKOS data model provides a standard, low-cost migration path for porting existing knowledge organization systems to the Semantic Web. SKOS also provides a lightweight, intuitive language for developing and sharing new knowledge organization systems. It may be used on its own, or in combination with formal knowledge representation languages such as the Web Ontology language (OWL). This document is the normative specification of the Simple Knowledge Organization System. It is intended for readers who are involved in the design and implementation of information systems, and who already have a good understanding of Semantic Web technology, especially RDF and OWL. For an informative guide to using SKOS, see the [SKOS-PRIMER].}

  abstract = {We have conducted a web-based questionnaire on the various concepts and topics of object-oriented programming that students on introductory courses found most difficult to cope with. A statistical analysis of our results shows that those topics that rely on a clear understanding of pointers and memory-related concepts (such as copy constructors and virtual functions) prove to be the most difficult. In other words, we believe these concepts are only hard because of the student's inability to comprehend what is happening to their program in memory, as they are incapable of creating a clear mental model of its execution. These results would suggest that a clearer approach to teaching these topics would be beneficial to students.We are currently working on a visualization-based approach to address these issues.},

  abstract = {Increasing collaborative work and distributing information creates a request for large-scale and flexible systems in regulated environments. A promising approach in the field of multi-agent system is the design and development of complex, hierarchical and critical systems. These systems require both a hierarchical structure that allows to make together different levels of abstraction within the same system and require the maintenance of social control of the various entities involved in these systems by using social norms. Several proposals on normative models for multi-agent systems have been made in order to design agent societies in norms-based environments. However, they are not adapted to support holonic systems, i.e. those who allow to model complex organizations involving several levels simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a new metamodel, called NCRIO (Norm, Capacity, Role, Interaction, and Organization), for the design of normative holonic multi-agent systems (NHMAS). This metamodel is an extension of the CRIO (Capacity, Role, Interaction, and Organization) metamodel, which allows the design of holonic multi-agent systems (HMAS). The NCRIO metamodel retains the properties of the HMASs and adds normative concepts (Norms and Contracts) to maintain social control in these systems. This new metamodel allows the design for complex (which require a hierarchical structure) and critical (which require social control) systems.},

  abstract = {Phishing emails are a primary mode of entry for attackers into an organization. A successful phishing attempt leads to unauthorized access to sensitive information and systems. However, automatically identifying phishing emails is often difficult since many phishing emails have composite features such as body text and metadata that are nearly indistinguishable from valid emails. This paper presents a novel machine learning-based framework, the DARTH framework, that characterizes and combines multiple models, with one model for each composite feature, that enables the accurate identification of phishing emails. The framework analyses each composite feature independently utilizing a multi-faceted approach using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and neural network-based techniques and combines the results of these analyses to classify the emails as malicious or legitimate. Utilizing the framework on more than 150,000 emails and training data from multiple sources, including the authors' emails and phishtank.com, resulted in the precision (correct identification of malicious observations to the total prediction of malicious observations) of 99.97\% with an f-score of 99.98\% and accurately identifying phishing emails 99.98\% of the time. Utilizing multiple machine learning techniques combined in an ensemble approach across a range of composite features yields highly accurate identification of phishing emails.},

After defining class, instance and is-a relation, we point out some typical inappropriate uses of is-a relation in existing ontologies and analyze the reasons why. Other topics are basic ontological distinction, part-of relation, and so on. As an advanced example of ontology, an ontology of representation is extensively discussed.

This work focuses on characterizing student barriers to active learning in synchronous online environments. The aim is to help novice educators develop a better understanding of those barriers and prepare more student-centered course plans for their active online classes. Towards this end, we adopt a qualitative research approach and study information from different sources: social media content, interviews, and surveys from students and expert educators. Through a thematic analysis, we craft a nuanced list of students' online active learning barriers within the themes of human-side, technological, and environmental barriers. Each barrier is explored from the three aspects of frequency, importance, and exclusiveness to active online classes. Finally, we conduct a summative study with 12 novice educators and explain the benefits of using our barrier list for course planning in active online classes.},

  abstract = {Background and Objectives: The use of efficient teaching methods has always been one of the fundamental issues in educational systems. Creating change and innovation, and using active learning methods can play an important role in coordinating content and educational methods (Dehghanzadeh \& et al, 2013). The dropout rate and low performance of Iranian students in national and international mathematics exams indicate the fact that current educational approaches have not been able to convey mathematical concepts and knowledge well (Zianejad Shirazi \& Gholtash, 2019). The interstice difficulty of concepts, skills and arguments in mathematics on one hand, and the inefficiency of teaching methods, lack of transparency in educational goals, and the declining academic motivation of learners on the other hand cause many learners to unable to achieve desirable results in mathematics give rise to their disgust and discouragement. This lesson has been done (Sheivandi, 2017). One of the active methods of learning is gamification. The term gamification means using the elements and mechanics of games in a non-game environment or inducing a sense of play in an environment in order to motivate and attract people to perform specific activities and solve various problems (Kapp, 2012). Gamification was first invented in 2002, however it was not well received until 2010. In 2011, a lot of academic research and studies began to form around it, although over time, a number of educational institutions still do not use it as an educational approach. However, the truth is that in places where this system has been implemented, good results have been obtained (Safai \& Rikhtegarzadeh, 2018). Gamification is the use of mechanics, dynamics, and game components such as stages, badges, points, competition, cooperation, and rewards in non- game fields to change behavior. (Asmuni \& et al, 2019). Although several studies have been conducted in recent years in the field of gamification inside the country and abroad, still, most studies have comparatively examined gamification as a general method and compared it to traditional methods, even so, fewer studies have examined the effect of the constituent elements of gamification. Therefore, in this study, the effect of competition and cooperation gamification elements on learning and motivation in fourth grade math mathematics course has been studied.Methods: In this study, quasi-experimental method and pretest-posttest design with three experimental groups and one control group were used. First, the status of the groups was determined with a pre-test score and then the effect of independent variables on dependent variables was investigated. The statistical population of the study included all male students in the fourth grade of elementary school in Divandarreh, who were studying in the academic year 2020-2021. The statistical sample size consisted of 64 fourth grade students consisting of two classes of 32 people who were randomly selected from all classes in the city area of one school. The research samples were randomly assigned to four groups of 16 people. The research instruments included researcher-made learning tests and motivation questionnaire of Aminifar and Saleh Sadeghpour whose reliability coefficient was calculated with Cronbach's alpha criterion for learning test, 0.93, approach motivation, 0.81, and avoidance motivation 0.87. The learning environment of the experimental groups was presented simultaneously and separately for ten sessions using the competition, cooperation and team competition of gamification elements and the control group in the common approach. Findings: The obtained data were analyzed in two sections: descriptive statistics and inferential statistics. In the descriptive statistics section, in order to identify the patterns governing the data, mean indices and standard deviation were examined. Kolmogorov - Smirnov test was used to determine the parametric or non-parametric data and to select the appropriate statistical test to assess the research hypotheses. Based on the results obtained from this test, at a significant level of five hundred learning and motivation variables in each of the groups of control, competition, cooperation and team competition have a normal distribution (Pvalue{$>$}0.05). In the inferential statistics section, multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) and Tukey post hoc test were used to test the research hypotheses. In order to test the assumptions of MANCOVA, Box test was used to examine the homogeneity of covariance matrices and Levin test was used to analyze the homogeneity of variances and the homogeneity test of regression coefficients. Data analysis in inferential statistics showed that with a significance level of less than 0.05, the use of competition, cooperation and team competition of gamification elements was effective on learning and motivation and a significant advantage in gamified environments over learning (P {$<$}0.05) was not observed. Additionally, data analysis showed that (p{$<$}0.05) the cooperation and team competition of gamification elements were more effective on increasing motivation than only competition.Conclusion: The analysis of data obtained from pre-test and post-test showed that the use of competition, cooperation and team competition of gamification elements has been effective on learning curve of the students. Findings of this study is consistent with the results of research done by Batooli \& et al (2018), Safai \& Rikhtegarzadeh (2019), The results also showed that the use of competition, cooperation and team competition of gamification elements reduce avoidance motivation and increases approach motivation. These findings are also consistent with the results of research by Kotob \& Ibrahim (2019), Arezi (2020), Cunha \& Barraqui \& de Freitas (2018). All the above researches have achieved significant results regarding the effectiveness of using gamification on motivation. However, the results of this study on the effect of gamification elements on achievement motivation are in conflict with the studies of Turkmen \& Soybas (2019), Mekler \& et al (2017) Lin \& et al (2017). Nonetheless, the results showed that there is a significant difference between the approach motivation of the gamified groups with the elements of cooperation and team competition, and the approach motivation of the gamified groups with the element of only competition. In other words, the use of the cooperation gamification element has a greater effect on increasing approach motivation than competition. These results are particularly consistent with the researches of Morschheusera \& Hamarib \& Maedchea (2019), Fekri (2016), Ter Vrugte \& et al (2015). The results of the present study in line with these studies showed that the use of gamification in the form of team competition and cooperation has been more effective in increasing the motivation of learners than the competitive mode. Gamification with the element of team competition and cooperation by enhancing learners' attention, risk-taking power, confidence, group reward, shared responsibility, and reducing anxiety and stress of failure, has been more effective on participants motivation than gamification with the element of only competition.},

Among other techniques that are often applied by instructors to counteract this issue, those related to the use of gaming elements seem to very promising. In this context, considering the use of game-like properties in learning scenarios, known as gamification, has received increasing interest by academia in recent years. However, its application in higher education can be challenging, due to some unwanted effects caused by the lack of proven design methodologies have been detected. Choosing the adequate formal process for gamification design has become an important success requirement. This work presents a systematic review of the gamification design frameworks discussed in the literature, providing a useful resource to educational practitioners as well as gamification designers and researchers. A total of 2314 unique works are initially recorded, based on queries in databases, libraries, journals and search engines. After applying a systematic filtering process, a definitive list of 40 works is more closely analysed. Next to review over relevant literature, an assessment of the main features found in the discussed approaches is given, while also categorizing them according to their main application field and its suitability in higher educational environments.},

Patient case examples are widely used in didactic coursework to teach this material, but engaging all learners in large, lecture-based courses remains a challenge. Interactive fiction (IF), a digital choose-your-own-adventure media, provides an accessible way for students to individually explore the narrative of a patient-case in a safe environment. Here, we report the development of interactive, digital patient-cases (eCases) using Twine, a free IF development platform. Fourteen eCases were developed in collaboration with 11 faculty members and were used in seven different PharmD courses over three semesters. eCase content was developed by faculty members for their respective instructional topics and accessed via Web browsers on students' personal electronic devices. eCases were received positively by students, with {$>$}\,90\% of students reporting that eCases were easy to use, helped them learn the material at their own pace, and gave them an opportunity to learn from mistakes. Student self-perceived confidence also increased significantly after eCase use. Faculty reported that eCases took more time to develop than conventional cases, but were easier to deliver and provided better student engagement. IF is an accessible media for creating and delivering low-fidelity interactive patient cases that can engage all students in a large class. eCases allow students to apply their knowledge, practice clinical decision-making, and safely learn from their mistakes. eCases are versatile and well suited for both in-person and virtual teaching across a variety of health professions programs to teach clinical decision-making.},

However, gamification approaches often cause competition between users, which might be inappropriate for working environments that seek cooperation. Drawing on the social interdependence theory, this paper provides a classification for gamification features and insights about the design of cooperative gamification. Using the example of an innova-tion community of a German engineering company, we present the design of a cooperative gamification approach and results from a first experimental evaluation. The findings indicate that the developed gamification approach has positive effects on perceived enjoyment and the intention towards knowledge sharing in the considered innovation community. Besides our conceptual contribu-tion, our findings suggest that cooperative gamification may be beneficial for cooperative working environments and represents a promising field for future research.},

  abstract = {Objective This paper seeks to advance the understanding of designing gamification and to provide a comprehensive method for developing gamified software. Method We approach the research problem via a design science research approach; firstly, by synthesizing the current body of literature on gamification design methods and by interviewing 25 gamification experts, producing a comprehensive list of design principles for developing gamified software. Secondly, and more importantly, we develop a detailed method for engineering of gamified software based on the gathered knowledge and design principles. Finally, we conduct an evaluation of the artifacts via interviews of ten gamification experts and implementation of the engineering method in a gamification project. Results As results of the study, we present the method and key design principles for engineering gamified software. Based on the empirical and expert evaluation, the developed method was deemed as comprehensive, implementable, complete, and useful. We deliver a comprehensive overview of gamification guidelines and shed novel insights into the nature of gamification development and design discourse.

  abstract = {During recent years, gamification has become a popular method of enriching information technologies. Several business analysts have made promising predictions about penetration of gamification, however, it has also been estimated that most gamification efforts will fail due to poor understanding of how gamification should be designed and implemented. Therefore, in this paper we seek to advance the understanding of best practices related to the gamification design process. We approach this research problem via a design science research approach; firstly, by synthesizing the current body of literature on gamification design methods and interviewing 25 gamification experts. Secondly, we develop a method for gamification design, based on the gathered knowledge. Finally, we conduct an evaluation of the method via interviews of 10 gamification experts. The results indicate that the developed method is comprehensive, complete and provides practical utility. We deliver a comprehensive overview of gamification guidelines and shed novel insights into the overall nature of the gamification development and design discourse.},

The methodology follows the philosophical discipline named ``social ontology'' combined with the neurological findings about fiction. The second half of the chapter analyzes some features of digital games: interaction, rules, and simulation. It presents the latest scientific results about the psychological ontogeny of games, the socio-ontological theories of games, and some of their applications to game analysis. During the development, designers and programmers constantly use naive interpretations about what games are. The chapter can lead designers and programmers to develop games not with subjective points of view but rather with an objective knowledge of the fundamental game properties.},

  abstract = {A programming language which is optimized for modelling multi-agent interaction within articulated social structures such as organizations is described with several examples of its functionality. The language is SDML, a strictly declarative modelling language which has object-oriented features and corresponds to a fragment of strongly grounded autoepistemic logic. The virtues of SDML include the ease of building complex models and the facility for representing agents flexibly as models of cognition as well as modularity and code reusability. Two representations of cognitive agents within organizational structures are reported and a Soar-to-SDML compiler is described. One of the agent representations is a declarative implementation of a Soar agent taken from the Radar-Soar model of Ye and Carley (1995). The Ye-Carley results are replicated but the declarative SDML implementation is shown to be much less computationally expensive than the more procedural Soar implementation. As a result, it appears that SDML supports more elaborate representations of agent cognition together with more detailed articulation of organizational structure than we have seen in computational organization theory. Moreover, by representing Soar-cognitive agents declaratively within SDML, that implementation of the Ye-Carley specification is necessarily consistent and sound with respect to the formal logic to which SDML corresponds.},

  abstract = {We present a new framework for model management based on system concepts and theory. Underlying the framework is a set of meta-modeling concepts that are useful in capturing W the semantics of the modeling process in a modeling environment. These concepts include the notions of a general-model type, type specialization, atomic and composite model versions, model instances, and parameterized versions. We describe these concepts both conceptually and formally and then briefly present a Model Description Language (MDL) that embodies them. While other researchers have suggested some of these concepts primarily in different contexts, this paper makes at least four valuable contributions: (1) the identification of fun- damental issues and principles related to model management; (2) the development and enhanced treatment of meta-modeling concepts specifically for model management; (3) the synthesis of those concepts into a coherent, unifying framework for model management; and (4) a dem- onstration of the practicality of those concepts through a prototype system implementation. Our framework proposes a graph-oriented, nonprocedural, and hierarchical approach for model composition. The framework also supports both model-solver independence and model-data independence. Moreover, it offers general solutions to two critical issues in model management: model-model linkage and model-data linkage. We argue that the system framework can serve as a guide for an effective design of a flexible and extensible model management system. An architecture of such a system and its prototype implementation-called SYMMS-are briefly described. Examples are presented to illustrate the features and advantages of our approach.},

  abstract = {In multiagent systems, agents may form coalitions in order to achieve their goals or to maximize their net group utility. Assuming that agents are self-interested, or potentially unreliable, they should implement some mechanism to deal with the uncertainty arising from interactions. Trust is usually chosen as the mechanism for modeling and reasoning about agents' reliability. Hence, we present an agent-based simulation model adapted to simulate a land expropriation scenario. Such model is composed of landowners who play the spatial prisoner's dilemma game and take into account the notion of trust to form coalitions. Moreover, the mechanism that landowners use to remain or to leave coalitions in accordance with their trust degree on their leader is described, giving details of how trust may influence their individual decision making. Finally, based on results of simulation experiments, we provide an analysis of how trust influences the coalition formation in such land expropriation scenario.},

  abstract = {Game generation systems perform automated, intelligent design of games (i.e. videogames, boardgames), reasoning about both the abstract rule system of the game and the visual realization of these rules. Although, as an instance of the problem of creative design, game generation shares some common research themes with other creative AI systems such as story and art generators, game generation extends such work by having to reason about dynamic, playable artifacts. Like AI work on creativity in other domains, work on game generation sheds light on the human game design process, offering opportunities to make explicit the tacit knowledge involved in game design and test game design theories. Finally, game generation enables new game genres which are radically customized to specific players or situations; notable examples are cell phone games customized for particular users and newsgames providing commentary on current events. We describe an approach to formalizing game mechanics and generating games using those mechanics, using WordNet and ConceptNet to assist in performing common-sense reasoning about game verbs and nouns. Finally, we demonstrate and describe in detail a prototype that designs micro-games in the style of Nintendo's WarioWare series.},

  abstract = {Videogame designers hope to sculpt gameplay, but actually work in the concrete medium of computation. What they create is code, artwork, dialogue---everything that goes inside a videogame cartridge. In other materially constrained design domains, design-support tools help bridge this gap by automating portions of a design in some cases, and helping a designer understand the implications of their design decisions in others. I investigate AI-based videogame-design support, and do so from the perspective of putting knowledge-representation and reasoning (KRR) at the front. The KRR-centric approach starts by asking whether we can formalize an aspect of the game-design space in a way suitable for automated or semi-automated analysis, and if so, what can be done with the results. It begins with the question, "what could a computer possibly do here?", attempts to show that the computer actually can do so, and then looks at the implications of the computer doing so for design support. To organize the space of game-design knowledge, I factor the broad notion of game mechanics mechanics into four categories: abstract mechanics, concrete audiovisual representations, thematic mappings, and input mappings. Concretely, I investigate KRR-centric formalizations in three domains, which probe into different portions of the four quadrants of game-design knowledge: 1. using story graphs and story-quality functions for writing interactive stories, 2. automatic game design focused on the "aboutness" of games, which auto-reskins videogames by formalizing generalized spaces of thematic references, and 3. enhancing mechanics-oriented videogame prototypes by encoding the game mechanics in temporal logic, so that they can be both played and queried.},

  abstract = {A system of systems (SoS) is a heterogeneous, autonomous and complex systems. This paper aims at proposing a new framework of SoS design. First, this research discusses the complex situations of SoS, and addresses the three issues of SoS design: 1) nonlinearity and discontinuity of design space, 2) emergence behavior, and 3) high uncertainty. The framework adopts a scenario design method, a multi-agent simulation method, and a robust design method to solve these issues, and integrates them in a sophisticated manner. A case study of designing subsidy polices for a distributed generation system, which is a typical SoS, is demonstrated.},

  abstract = {This article introduces the Japanese concept of "Ba" to organizational theory. Ba (equivalent to "place" in English) is a shared space for emerging relationships. It can be a physical, virtual, or mental space. Knowledge, in contrast to information, cannot be separated from the context -- it is embedded in ba. To support the process of knowledge creation, a foundation in ba is required. This article develops and explains four specific platforms and their relationships to knowledge creation. Each of the knowledge conversion modes is promoted by a specific ba. A self-transcending process of knowledge creation can be supported by providing ba on different organizational levels. This article presents case studies of three companies that employ ba on the team, division, and corporate level to enhance knowledge creation.},

  abstract = {Plagiarism is a serious problem in academia and students cheat for various reasons, but whateverthereasonsuchbehaviourshouldnotbeaccepted. Whileitiseasytocontrolplagiarism in classrooms with few students it can be a challenge to do it in a classroom with one hundred students or more. To help teacher detect plagiarism similarity detection tools are built, usually called plagiarism detection tools. While in academia plagiarism can be done in many areas the two most common are textual and programming assignments. In this thesis, the focus is on detecting plagiarism in student programming assignments. Since the tools are not perfect there is always room for improvement and one possibility to improve the plagiarism detection quality is the usage of preprocessing techniques. Preprocessing techniques have been used in many plagiarism detection tools but there is not much research focusing on the effects of such techniques. To investigate the effect of preprocessing techniques on plagiarism detection tools an experiment was conducted on six tools using five techniques on two different datasets, whereby one dataset is publicly available. To be more precise the six tools were actually three tools whereby each tool had two modes to operatethespecializedmodewhichisspeciallydevelopedtoperformasource-codecomparison and textual mode developed for normal text comparison. In this experiment two hypotheses were stated, one focusing on the differences between the preprocessing techniques and when no preprocessing technique is used and other focusing on differences between two different techniques. In addition to the hypothesis one research question was stated to give more insight into the effects of the preprocessing techniques. Resultsoftheexperimentwereanalysedquantitativelyusingthemultifactoranalysisofvariance and qualitatively by analysing the most interesting cases. The whole process of detection and statistical analysis was automated using the newly developed system called Multiple Plagiarism Checker and the system R. The experimental results confirmed both hypotheses showing that using preprocessing has a positive effect on the quality of plagiarism detection and that some techniques gave better results than others. The most interesting result of this research is that by using preprocessing techniques textual versions of the tools outperformed in some cases the specialized version of the tool developed specifically for source-code similarity detection.},

  abstract = {Background Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a well-established treatment for panic disorder, but many fewer patients receive this treatment compared to medication-based therapy. Mobile app-based interactive CBT using a chatbot can increase patient access to CBT. We performed a preliminary study to determine whether short-term use of a newly developed chatbot is feasible and effective for relieving panic symptoms. Method Forty-one patients were randomly assigned to either a chatbot group (n\,=\,21) or control group (n\,=\,20) for a period of 4 weeks. The chatbot group was guided in the use of the chatbot application, while the control group was provided with a book on panic disorder. Main results The severity of panic disorder was significantly decreased in the chatbot group, but not in the control group. The social phobia score was significantly decreased and the control helplessness score was significantly increased in the chatbot group compared to the control group. Discussion and conclusion We found that mobile app-based interactive CBT using the chatbot was feasible and effective for reducing the severity of panic symptoms. Using this novel approach to provide CBT would allow clinicians to effect positive therapeutic outcomes with easy accessibility, interactivity, and self-management for patients with panic symptoms.},

  abstract = {Coalition formation is an important capability of automated negotiation among self-interested agents. In order for coalitions to be stable, a key question that must be answered is how the gains from cooperation are to be distributed. Recent research has revealed that traditional solution concepts, such as the Shapley value, core, least core, and nucleolus, are vulnerable to various manipulations in open anonymous environments such as the Internet. These manipulations include submitting false names, collusion, and hiding some skills. To address this, a solution concept called the anonymity-proof core, which is robust against such manipulations, was developed. However, the representation size of the outcome function in the anonymity-proof core (and similar concepts) requires space exponential in the number of agents/skills. This paper proposes a compact representation of the outcome function, given that the characteristic function is represented using a recently introduced compact language that explicitly specifies only coalitions that introduce synergy. This compact representation scheme can successfully express the outcome function in the anonymity-proof core. Furthermore, this paper develops a new solution concept, the anonymity-proof nucleolus, that is also expressible in this compact representation. We show that the anonymity-proof nucleolus always exists, is unique, and is in the anonymity-proof core (if the latter is nonempty), and assigns the same value to symmetric skills.

This way, the authors would like to give implementation guidelines based on the foundations implicit culture based multiagent systems as put forward earlier.},

In order to increase artificial intelligence of these kind of games one of prerequisites is to determine a model of different players' behaviour which would enable the creation of suitable intelligent agents that would facilitate better communication and more logical cooperation between individual players in order for them to achieve the game's goal more quickly and more efficiently. In this article a research about selected aspects of MMORPG players' behaviour is presented and its results are elaborated as a part of prerequisites for creation of appropriate intelligent agents for facilitating better cooperation between players which is described as a part of future research.},

  abstract = {Large-scale multi-agent systems (LSMAS) development methods are becoming a necessity in a world of ever growing numbers of computer agents incorporated in various devices and services used by people in all areas of life. Organization in such large-scale systems, becomes therefore a very relevant concept in research on LSMAS, as the mentioned agents are expected to cooperate, com- pete, and share information, hence improving quality of peoples' life. An example application domain of LSMAS are massive multi-player online games (MMOG), and their specific genre -- MMO role-playing games (MMORPG). MMORPGs provide us with the opportunity to study both large-scale virtual interaction of players (agents), and coor- dination of large-scale distributed artificial intelligence. In this paper, we will present an ontology of organizational concepts, suited for LSMAS development, merged with an ontology containing elements of a specific MMORPG. Combining these two ontologies with a special accent on identifying elements and aspects of organization, will hopefully present us with a basis for LSMAS structures which follow organizational constraints and are suitable for LSMAS development in the MMORPG context.},

  abstract = {Large-scale multi-agent systems (LSMAS), a rather novel concept in the domain of multi-agent systems (MAS), are reaching for soaring heights in the wake of the Internet of Everything era. Interacting pieces of software on interconnected machines, enabled by rapid development of the Internet and connected devices, are creating systems comprising tens of thousands, even millions, of agents. Each agent is thus situated in an environment with numerous other elements, and interaction is inevitable. Such a situation benefits from organisational modelling of the system. Using an organisational metamodel, which provides concepts for definitions of several organisational models, introduces upgraded time and effort efficiency into LSMAS organisational modelling, thus aiding in cost and time efficiency of design and development of distributed software. This chapter introduces a novel method of LSMAS organisational modelling using an organisational metamodel which makes it easier to model an LSMAS at various levels of abstraction. The presented metamodel is a work-in-progress description based on an ontology being developed that comprises LSMAS organisational concepts. Some features of the metamodel are presented, in this chapter, using two distinct examples of LSMAS application domains. Main features differentiating the proposed metamodel from the existent LSMAS organisational models also include concepts for modelling interorganisational dynamics.},

  abstract = {Knowledge management is the concept that can turn the tide in the context of market competitiveness and competitive advantage in any area of organised activity. The benefit knowledge management may bring to an organisation is not tied to human organisations only though, as artificial agents, initially created as an imitation of humans, can benefit from organised and accessible useful knowledge as well. This paper covers a number of conceptual modelling examples following the theoretical settings presented within the paper. These examples emphasise the importance for clear and non- biased definition of knowledge management concepts and contents, with the goal of fostering knowledge sharing culture in organisations, as well as creating knowledge accessible to artificial agents and applicable to various situations where artificial intelligence can be of service utilising the concept of systems comprising agents both human and artificial. Therefore the main quest of this paper is to argue towards demonstrating the benefits of conceptual modelling in knowledge management using domain specific and general cases, respecting the concept of fair argument, thus providing reasoning both in favour and against the basic topic of this paper. The main method of achieving the set goal is based on theoretical overview and analysis of the proposed cases and already published research. The results that are presented in this paper are a good addition to both the research areas of knowledge managements and multiagent systems. The combination is a welcome addition in the modern world where distributed computing is gaining power and informatisation is a global and omnipresent process. Emphasising the importance of developing systems that help bridge the communication between human and artificial agents, especially if they happen to be working in the same organisation, is an interesting problem with rising significance, since artificial agents are increasingly present in historically human organisations. An interface fostering the communication process between human and artificial agents that suppresses the necessity for direct interaction of the included entities, but increases the importance of knowledge modelling and management towards effortless cooperation of said entities, certainly is a welcome concept towards the rising popularity of artificial intelligence in general.},

  abstract = {The most popular and frequent methods of conducting a system of agents, of smallor large-scale, are those based on swarm intelligence, and organisational models. Organisational models for multi-agent systems are being developed alongside their role in the modern world. Technological improvements lead to creation of systems comprising thousands, or millions, of agents -- large-scale multiagent system (LSMAS). Numerous LSMAS application domains (Internet of Everything (IoE), massively multi-player online games (MMOGs), smart cities, etc.) make LSMAS a genuinely useful concept in the modern era. Recent studies argue higher efficiency of LSMAS with imposed organisation, as opposed to systems with emerging intelligence. This makes organisational modelling of LSMAS a particularly interesting research subject. Organisational model based on ontology comprising LSMAS-related organisational concepts, built conforming to modern organisational perspectives for LSMAS, is a step towards easier LSMAS modelling. The ontology is basis for an organisational metamodel for LSMAS, which, coupled with graph grammars and logic, is suitable for modelling organisational dynamics, especially in the domain of massively multi-player online role-playing games (MMORPGs).},

  abstract = {Have you ever wondered about the possible ways of specifying a flow of communication between agents in a distributed multiagent system? Members of the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory of University of Zagreb Faculty of Organization and Informatics (AI Lab) are here to present their take on this challenge using process calculus and the idea that artificial agents can be considered as abstraction of processes. A new programming language for specification of communication flows is being developed as one of the main goals of O\_HAI\ding{175}Games project led by the head of the AI Lab, Full Prof. Markus Schatten. But it's not just about making them chat; it's about orchestrating who they talk to, how they converse, and what they exchange. We'll highlight our progress with two examples: a communication flow within a streamed holographic 3D game engine being developed as a part of the same project, and describing a part of a distributed agent-centred knowledge-graph-based randomised environment generator for creating interactive fiction using Inform 7 programming language.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Gamification has been widely used to design better educational systems aiming to increase students' concentration, motivation, engagement, flow experience, and others positive experiences. With advances in research on gamification in education, over the past few years, many studies have highlighted the need to tailor the gamification design properties to match individual students' needs, characteristics and preferences. Thus, different studies have been conducted to personalize the gamification in education. However, the results are still contradictory and need to be better understood to advance this field. To provide a complete understanding of this research domain, we conducted a systematic literature review to summarize the results and discussions on studies that cover the field of tailored gamified education. Following a systematic process, we analysed 2108 studies and identified 19 studies to answer our research questions. The results indicate that most of the studies only consider students' gamer types to tailor the systems, and most of the experiments do not provide sufficient statistical evidence, especially regarding learning performance using tailored gamified systems. Based on the results, we also provided an agenda with different challenges, opportunities, and research directions to improve the literature on tailored gamification in education. Our study contributes to the field of gamification design in education.},

The tool development phase began with initiation, then pre-production, production, testing, beta testing, and ended with the release phase. Once the malware awareness tool was developed, functionality tests and awareness level tests were conducted on university students to ensure the tool is fully operative. Through the tests, it was shown that this tool was received with positive responses from its target users. As for the awareness level test, a majority of 15 students were aware of the purpose of the gamification in the malware awareness tool. In a nutshell, the malware awareness tool that was developed raised university student's consciousness on malwares and increased their awareness level pertaining to Internet threats.},

After presenting the scientific background, we define the notions of artifact in the A\&A meta-model, discuss how it affects the notion of intelligence in MAS, and show its application to a number of agent-related research fields.},

  abstract = {Given the extraordinary growth in online documents, methods for automated extraction of semantic relations became popular, and shortly after, became necessary. This thesis proposes a new deterministic language model, with the associated artifact, which acts as an online Syntactic and Semantic Framework (SSF) for the extraction of morphosyntactic and semantic relations. The model covers all fundamental linguistic fields: Morphology (formation, composition, and word paradigms), Lexicography (storing words and their features in network lexicons), Syntax (the composition of words in meaningful parts: phrases, sentences, and pragmatics), and Semantics (determining the meaning of phrases). To achieve this, a new tagging system with more complex structures was developed. Instead of the commonly used vectored systems, this new tagging system uses tree-likeT-structures with hierarchical, grammatical Word of Speech (WOS), and Semantic of Word (SOW) tags. For relations extraction, it was necessary to develop a syntactic (sub)model of language, which ultimately is the foundation for performing semantic analysis. This was achieved by introducing a new `O-structure', which represents the union of WOS/SOW features from T-structures of words and enables the creation of syntagmatic patterns. Such patterns are a powerful mechanism for the extraction of conceptual structures (e.g., metonymies, similes, or metaphors), breaking sentences into main and subordinate clauses, or detection of a sentence's main construction parts (subject, predicate, and object). Since all program modules are developed as general and generative entities, SSF can be used for any of the Indo-European languages, although validation and network lexicons have been developed for the Croatian language only. The SSF has three types of lexicons (morphs/syllables, words, and multi-word expressions), and the main words lexicon is included in the Global Linguistic Linked Open Data (LLOD) Cloud, allowing interoperability with all other world languages. The SSF model and its artifact represent a complete natural language model which can be used to extract the lexical relations from single sentences, paragraphs, and also from large collections of documents.},

  abstract = {Information spreading is often analyzed comparatively on small-world and random networks. Topological differences between small-world networks and random networks are believed to be main reasons that lead to various different spreading behaviours on these two types of networks. Besides those differences, the heterogeneity of spreading abilities of network ties is often overlooked. In this study, we analyze the impacts of the heterogeneity on information spreading over small-world networks and random networks. Through simulations on both artificial and realistic networks, we find that the strong heterogeneity leads to lower efficiency of spreading over small-world networks. The heterogeneity not only slows down the spreading pace, but also lengthens the life span of the information spread over small-world networks. Under such strong heterogeneity, random networks, which are affected little, are better for information spreading. However, as the heterogeneity decreases, small-world networks finally exceed random networks when regarding information spreading. We also conduct experiments to review the weak ties assumption in small-world networks. We find that the heterogeneity forces information to bypass weak ties and travels along strongly connected nodes.},

The versatility and flexibility of both AI and telemedicine gave the endless possibilities for development and these can be seen in the literature reviewed in this paper. The trends in the development of the utilization of this technology can be classified in to four: patient monitoring, healthcare information technology, intelligent assistance diagnosis, and information analysis collaboration. Each trend will be discussed and presented with examples of recent literature and the problems they aim to address. Related references will also be tabulated and categorized to see the future and potential of this current trend in telemedicine.},

Therefore microblogging web-sites are rich sources of data for opinion mining and sentiment analysis. Because microblogging has appeared relatively recently, there are a few research works that were devoted to this topic. In our paper, we focus on using Twitter, the most popular microblogging platform, for the task of sentiment analysis. We show how to automatically collect a corpus for sentiment analysis and opinionmining purposes. We performlinguistic analysis of the collected corpus and explain discovered phenomena. Using the corpus, we build a sentiment classifier, that is able to determine positive, negative and neutral sentiments for a document. Experimental evaluations show that our proposed techniques are efficient and performs better than previously proposed methods. In our research, we worked with English, however, the proposed technique can be used with any other language. 1.},

  abstract = {Over the years, multi-agent systems (MAS) technologies have shown their usefulness in creating distributed applications focused on autonomous intelligent processes. For this purpose, many frameworks for supporting multi-agent systems have been developed, normally oriented towards a particular type of agent architecture (e.g., reactive or deliberative agents). It is common, for example, for a multi-agent platform supporting the BDI (Belief, Desire, Intention) model to provide this agent model exclusively. In most of the existing agent platforms, it is possible to develop either behavior-based agents or deliberative agents based on the BDI cycle, but not both. In this sense, there is a clear lack of flexibility when agents need to perform part of their decision-making process according to the BDI paradigm and, in parallel, require some other behaviors that do not need such a deliberation process. In this context, this paper proposes the introduction of an agent architecture called Flexible Agent Architecture (FAA) that supports the development of multi-agent systems, where each agent can define its actions in terms of different computational models (BDI, procedural, neural networks, etc.) as behaviors, and combine these behaviors as necessary in order to achieve its goals. The FAA architecture has been integrated into a real agent platform, SPADE, thus extending its original capabilities in order to develop applications featuring reactive, deliberative, and hybrid agents. The integration has also adapted the existing facilities of SPADE to all types of behaviors inside agents, for example, the coordination of agents by using a presence notification mechanism, which is a unique feature of SPADE. The resulting SPADE middleware has been used to implement a case study in a simulated robotics scenario, also shown in the paper.},

  abstract = {Diverse text generation has been emerging as an important topic of natural language generation. Traditional studies on question generation mainly investigate how to generate one question based on a given input (one-to-one). In this paper, we focus on a more complex question generation task, i.e., generating a series of questions for each set of keywords (oneto-many). As an effort towards this, we propose a novel neural generative model, which incorporates context information and control signal to produce multiple diverse questions from a given fixed set of keywords. The control signal is designed to increase the diversity of questions by capturing the diverse patterns from the entire dataset. The context information is used to guarantee the generated questions are highly related to the given keywords. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we collect a dataset which contains 62835 questions with respect to 12567 sets of keywords.1 To the best of our knowledge, it's the first Chinese financial dataset for diverse question generation. The experimental results show that our model outperforms the competitor methods in terms of BLEU and Distinct. The qualitative evaluation indicates that our model is able to generate diverse and meaningful questions.},

  abstract = {Heterogeneous, "aggregated" patterns in the spatial distributions of individuals are almost universal across living organisms, from bacteria to higher vertebrates. Whereas specific features of aggregations are often visually striking to human eyes, a heuristic analysis based on human vision is usually not sufficient to answer fundamental questions about how and why organisms aggregate. What are the individual-level behavioral traits that give rise to these features? When qualitatively similar spatial patterns arise from purely physical mechanisms, are these patterns in organisms biologically significant, or are they simply epiphenomena that are likely characteristics of any set of interacting autonomous individuals? If specific features of spatial aggregations do confer advantages or disadvantages in the fitness of group members, how has evolution operated to shape individual behavior in balancing costs and benefits at the individual and group levels? Mathematical models of social behaviors such as schooling in fishes provide a promising avenue to address some of these questions. However, the literature on schooling models has lacked a common framework to objectively and quantitatively characterize relationships between individual-level behaviors and group-level patterns. In this paper, we briefly survey similarities and differences in behavioral algorithms and aggregation statistics among existing schooling models. We present preliminary results of our efforts to develop a modeling framework that synthesizes much of this previous work, and to identify relationships between behavioral parameters and group-level statistics.},

  abstract = {From a software engineering perspective, agent systems are a specialization of object-oriented (OO) systems, in which individual objects have their own threads of control and their own goals or sense of purpose. Engineering such systems is most naturally approached as an extension of object-oriented systems engineering. In particular, the Unified Modeling Language (UML) can be naturally extended to support the distinctive requirements of multi-agent systems. One such requirement results from the increasing emphasis on the correspondence between multi-agent systems and social systems. Sociological analogies are proving fruitful models for agent-oriented constructions, while sociologists increasingly use agents as a modeling tool for studying social systems. We combine several existing organizational models for agents, including AALAADIN, dependency theory, interaction protocols, and holonics, in a general theoretical framework, and show how UML can be applied and extended to capture constructions in that framework.},

For example, recent work has correlated Twitter messages with influenza rates in the United States; but this has largely been the extent of mining Twitter for public health. In this work, we consider a broader range of public health applications for Twitter. We apply the recently introduced Ailment Topic Aspect Model to over one and a half million health related tweets and discover mentions of over a dozen ailments, including allergies, obesity and insomnia. We introduce extensions to incorporate prior knowledge into this model and apply it to several tasks: tracking illnesses over times (syndromic surveillance), measuring behavioral risk factors, localizing illnesses by geographic region, and analyzing symptoms and medication usage. We show quantitative correlations with public health data and qualitative evaluations of model output. Our results suggest that Twitter has broad applicability for public health research.},

The book examines several classes of recommendation algorithms, including Machine learning algorithms Community detection algorithms Filtering algorithms Various efficient and robust product recommender systems using machine learning algorithms are helpful in filtering and exploring unseen data by users for better prediction and extrapolation of decisions. These are providing a wider range of solutions to such challenges as imbalanced data set problems, cold-start problems, and long tail problems. This book also looks at fundamental ontological positions that form the foundations of recommender systems and explain why certain recommendations are predicted over others. Techniques and approaches for developing recommender systems are also investigated. These can help with implementing algorithms as systems and include A latent-factor technique for model-based filtering systems Collaborative filtering approaches Content-based approaches Finally, this book examines actual systems for social networking, recommending consumer products, and predicting risk in software engineering projects},

The proposed programming language for communica- tion flows specification attempts to overcome this challenge by providing explicit communication flows definitions, that agents' communications component relies on, which enables enhanced orchestration capabilities. Use cases that are covered in this paper are in the domains of streaming audio, video, and sensors data, and provide a couple of examples of how the proposed programming language may be used.},

  abstract = {Multiagent systems are often characterized by complex, and sometimes unpredictable interactions amongst their autonomous components. While these systems can provide robust and scalable solutions to a variety of problems, the inherent complexity presents a barrier to their analysis, understanding, debugging and modification. In the work presented here, we seek to overcome this problem by modeling the execution of a multiagent system as a graph, which admits the application of techniques from the well- established field of algorithmic graph theory. In particular, we employ graph search and isomorphism computation to find repeating patterns of communication within a multiagent simulation. We argue, and demonstrate empirically, that the graph, even if it is too large to fit into main memory, carries useful properties, which allow these operations to be performed efficiently. We further show that the resulting patterns (which tend to be manageable in size) present a useful view of a simulation, and facilitate the comparison of different simulations against one another. This is specifically illustrated by applying a tool called IntelliTrace, which implements our approach, to multiagent models of the national airspace. At the same time, the tool, and its underlying methodology, is domain-independent, and can be used for the analysis, development and testing of a variety of multiagent systems.},

Traditionally, this balancing act requires extensive periods of expert analysis, play testing and debates. While automated gameplay is able to predict outcomes of parameter changes, current approaches mainly rely on heuristic or optimal strategies to generate agent behavior. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of deep player behavior models to represent a player population (n = 213) of the massively multiplayer online role-playing game Aion, which are used, in turn, to generate individual agent behaviors. Results demonstrate significant balance differences in opposing enemy encounters and show how these can be regulated. Moreover, the analytic methods proposed are applied to identify the balance relationships between classes when fighting against each other, reflecting the original developers' design.},

The conducted works may be structured along two main points of view: an agent-centred point of view (ACPV) and an organisation-centred point of view (OCPV). In both approaches the central notion of multi-agent organisation dynamic is considered. In ACPV, this notion leads to a kind of informal, bottom-up, emergent phenomena that we regroup under the general term of self-organisation. In OCPV, this notion gives birth to a huge set of works related to the reorganisation of the formal, top-down, pre-existent organisations that are installed in the MAS. In this paper, we propose to position these two approaches to build a comprehensive picture of organisation dynamic in multi-agent systems.},

In our solution, we focus on the use of MS Hololens to expand the virtual space used by the user in virtual reality, so that it is possible to monitor the user and his activity in VR. Our work consists of implementing a virtual and augmented reality network connection that makes it possible for an external observer to break through these technological barriers and see a virtual representation of the user over the real world. Along with the holographic representation of the virtual user, it is also possible to see all selected interactable objects with which the virtual reality user interacts.

  abstract = {In open environments, agents depend on reputation and trust mechanisms to evaluate the behavior of potential partners. The scientific research in this field has considerably increased, and in fact, reputation and trust mechanisms have been already considered a key elements in the design of multi-agent systems. In this paper we provide a survey that, far from being exhaustive, intends to show the most representative models that currently exist in the literature. For this enterprise we consider several dimensions of analysis that appeared in three existing surveys, and provide new dimensions that can be complementary to the existing ones and that have not been treated directly. Moreover, besides showing the original classification that each one of the surveys provide, we also classify models that where not taken into account by the original surveys. The paper illustrates the proliferation in the past few years of models that follow a more cognitive approach, in which trust and reputation representation as mental attitudes is as important as the final values of trust and reputation. Furthermore, we provide an objective definition of trust, based on Castelfranchi's idea that trust implies a decision to rely on someone.},

Game AI borrows many techniques from the broader field of AI, from simple finite state machines to state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms. Among these techniques, fuzzy logic is one of the tools that must be present in the arsenal of a good videogame AI developer, due to the simplicity of its formulation coupled with its expressive power. In this paper, we introduce the field of game AI and review the use of fuzzy logic in games, looking both at industry and research. We outline its benefits, address its shortcomings and present its practical uses.},

So, healthcare in the digital era is experimenting with adopting robotics to provide personal healthcare to patients in need. In this chapter, the needs of elderly patients are identified and solutions are provided with a personalized robot. Emergency situations can also be predicted more quickly with the vital information provided by IoT devices and necessary action can be suggested using artificial intelligence. IoT-based wearable devices are used to obtain necessary health data from patients. These data are processed and decision-making is carried out by AI, whereas the required action is taken by the designed robot. Humanoid robots can be designed for providing healthcare and physical assistance to elderly patients and those with chronic conditions. Animal-like robots can also be designed that act like pets as a solution for those with psychosocial issues. The major goal is to review robots to develop a robot in the future that can prevent interventions, perform multiple functions, provide motivational interaction style, provide better educational data, and alert an ambulance in case of an emergency.},

Austin's speech act theory is used to show that real people can act in virtual communities in ways that both establish practices and moral expectations, and warrant strong identifications between themselves and their online identities. Rawls' conception of a social practice is used to analyze the nature of the wrong and the stage-setting aspect of engaging in a practice.},

  abstract = {This article reviews legal applications of logic, with a particularly marked concern for logical models of legal argument. We argue that the law is a rich test bed and important application field for logic-based AI research. First applications of logic to the representation of legal regulations are reviewed, where the main emphasis is on representation and where the legal conclusions follow from that representation as a matter of deduction. This includes the representation of deontic concepts, normative positions, legal ontologies, time and change. Then legal applications of logic are reviewed where legal rules are not just applied but are the object of reasoning and discourse. This includes arguing about applying statutory rules in unforeseen circumstances, interpretative reasoning in light of the facts of a case, and evidential reasoning to establish the facts of a case. This part of the review has special emphasis on argumentation-based approaches. This also holds for the final part, which discusses formal models of legal procedure and of multi-agent interaction in legal proceedings. The review concludes with identifying some of the main open research problems. The review shows that modern legal applications of logic confirm the recent trend of widening the scope of logic from deduction to information flow, argumentation and interaction.},

To address these issues, we present Foodbot, a chatbot-based mHealth application for goal-oriented just-in-time (JIT) healthy eating interventions. Powered by a large-scale food knowledge graph, Foodbot utilizes automatic speech recognition and mobile messaging interface to record food intake. Moreover, Foodbot allows users to set goals and guides their behavior toward the goals via JIT notification prompts, interactive dialogues, and personalized recommendation. Altogether, the Foodbot framework demonstrates the use of open-source data, tools, and platforms to build a practical mHealth solution for supporting healthy eating lifestyle in the general population.},

The material is unified by the underlying theme of world semantics. All of the topics are explained clearly using devices such as tableau proofs, and their relation to current philosophical issues and debates are discussed. Students with a basic understanding of classical logic will find this book an invaluable introduction to an area that has become of central importance in both logic and philosophy. It will also interest people working in mathematics and computer science who wish to know about the area.},

  abstract = {Background: Diabetes management apps may have positive effects on diabetes self-management. It remains unclear, however, which app features are particularly effective and encourage sustained app usage. Behavior change techniques (BCTs) and gamification are promising approaches to improve user engagement. However, little is known about the frequency BCTs and gamification techniques (GTs) are actually used. This app review aims to provide an overview of BCTs and GTs in current diabetes management apps. Methods: Google's Play Store was searched for applications using a broad search strategy (keyword: ``diabetes''). We limited our research to freely available apps. A total of 56 apps matched the inclusion criteria and were reviewed in terms of the features they offer to support self-management. We used a taxonomy comprising 29 BCTs and 17 GTs to evaluate the applications. Two independent raters tested and evaluated each app. Results: Interrater agreement was high (ICC = .75 for BCTs; ICC = .90 for GTs). An average of 7.4 BCTs (SD = 3.1) and an average of 1.4 out of 17 GTs (SD = 1.6) were implemented in each app. Five out of 29 BCTs accounted for 55.8\% of the BCTs identified in total. The GT most often identified was ``feedback'' and accounted for 50\% of the GTs. Conclusions: The potential of BCTs and GTs in diabetes management apps has not been fully exploited yet. Only very restricted sets of BCTs and gamification features were implemented. Systematic research on the efficacy of specific BCTs and GTs is needed to provide further guidance for app design.},

  abstract = {Gamification of learning -- the application of game design elements to learning activities -- is currently a hot, if controversial, trend in education. Proponents of gamification, on the one hand, claim that gamification leads to learning gains. They assert that gamification reinforces important skills in education, such as problem-solving, collaboration, and communication. Furthermore, they maintain that need for interaction in a gamified approach to education encourages students to play an active role in the learning process, thereby increasing student engagement in online forums, projects, and other learning activities. Detractors of gamification, meanwhile, argue that it derails learning with aimless distractions, adds unnecessary competition stress, and fails to take into account certain learners' pedagogical needs. Research on gamification is gathering momentum and promises to help adjudicate many of the issues raised in this controversy. We therefore conducted a second-order review to examine the evidence-based discourse on this aspect of gamification. We found that while the review literature adequately summarizes evidence in support of effectiveness in terms of cognitive, emotional/motivational, and behavioural outcomes, certain design issues remain unaddressed. When addressing effectiveness, a concern for how the nature of learning objectives and the quality of learning activities that are gamified is noticeably absent in the field. Furthermore, a contextual bias towards STEM courses limits the generalizability of evidence to other contexts. The review literature further suggests a publication bias and an over-emphasis on positive effects. Nevertheless, recognising the general scope of the research, its theory, and evidence, will help instructors and curriculum designers interested in gamifying courses decide how to approach gamified course designs to use in a specific context. Highlighting current limitations in the evidence-based discourse may benefit the design of future research by drawing attention to the types of evidence that will help advance gamification in educational settings.},

First, we extend the recently proposed Argument Interchange Format (AIF) to express arguments with a structure based on Walton's theory of argumentation schemes. Then, we describe an implementation of this ontology using the RDF Schema Semantic Web-based ontology language, and demonstrate how our ontology enables the representation of networks of arguments on the Semantic Web. Finally, we present a pilot Semantic Web-based system, ArgDF, through which users can create arguments using different argumentation schemes and can query arguments using a Semantic Web query language. Manipulation of existing arguments is also handled in ArgDF: users can attack or support parts of existing arguments, or use existing parts of an argument in the creation of new arguments. ArgDF also enables users to create new argumentation schemes. As such, ArgDF is an open platform not only for representing arguments, but also for building interlinked and dynamic argument networks on the Semantic Web. This initial public-domain tool is intended to seed a variety of future applications for authoring, linking, navigating, searching, and evaluating arguments on the Web. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {The coalition structure generation problem is a natural abstraction of one of the most important challenges in multi-agent systems: How can a number of agents divide themselves into groups in order to improve their performance? More precisely, the coalition structure generation problem focuses on partitioning the set of agents into mutually disjoint coalitions so that the total reward from the resulting coalitions is maximized. This problem is computationally challenging, even under quite restrictive assumptions. This has prompted researchers to develop a range of algorithms and heuristic approaches for solving the problem efficiently. This article presents a survey of these approaches. In particular, it surveys the main dynamic-programming approaches and anytime algorithms developed for coalition structure generation, and considers techniques specifically developed for a range of compact representation schemes for coalitional games. It also considers settings where there are constraints on the coalitions that are allowed to form, as well as settings where the formation of one coalition could influence the performance of other co-existing coalitions.},

Researcher is going to use NLP for automatic question generation system. As in any education system, examination is conducted to judge the caliber of the students. So to conduct the examination, educator needs to generate the questions manually which is very time consuming process, so researcher has decided to develop system through which, automatic questions can be generated, and time and efforts will be reduced. To develop automatic question generation, many researcher has presented their work and many algorithms are proposed to generate the automatic question from given sentence or text. This paper presents review of work to generate questions automatic from inputted text. Paper reviews methodologies with respect to the phases of question generation.},

  abstract = {Over the last few decades, rapid progress in AI, machine learning, and deep learning has resulted in new techniques and various tools for manipulating multimedia. Though the technology has been mostly used in legitimate applications such as for entertainment and education, etc., malicious users have also exploited them for unlawful or nefarious purposes. For example, high-quality and realistic fake videos, images, or audios have been created to spread misinformation and propaganda, foment political discord and hate, or even harass and blackmail people. The manipulated, high-quality and realistic videos have become known recently as Deepfake. Various approaches have since been described in the literature to deal with the problems raised by Deepfake. To provide an updated overview of the research works in Deepfake detection, we conduct a systematic literature review (SLR) in this paper, summarizing 112 relevant articles from 2018 to 2020 that presented a variety of methodologies. We analyze them by grouping them into four different categories: deep learning-based techniques, classical machine learning-based methods, statistical techniques, and blockchain-based techniques. We also evaluate the performance of the detection capability of the various methods with respect to different datasets and conclude that the deep learning-based methods outperform other methods in Deepfake detection.},

The aim of the research is to study the procedural approach to the organization knowledge potential management, to distinguish the main knowledge management processes and to present suggestions on how to improve the knowledge management process model. The organization's knowledge potential in this study is defined, as the organization's resources and market opportunities, generating its knowledge potential, complexity and effective management of which create prerequisites for meeting the changing individual user needs, creating reciprocal value, uniqueness and leadership in the global marketplace. The conceptual knowledge management process model has been improved, based on the research. The first step in the model is the choice of a knowledge strategy, covering aspects of the formation and selection of strategic decision-making in knowledge potential management. The choice of an appropriate knowledge strategy brings to its implementation through a process of knowledge management cycle, consisting of knowledge acquisition, sharing, development, preservation and application of it. The knowledge management process model is completed with an evaluation of the knowledge strategy implementation.

We refer to theories in which one or more groups of agents (``coalitions'') deliberately get together to jointly determine withingroup actions, while interacting noncooperatively across groups. The chapter describes a variety of solution concepts, using an umbrella model that adopts an explicit real-time approach. Players band together, perhaps disband later and re-form in shifting alliances, all the while receiving payoffs at each date according to the coalition structure prevailing at the time. We use this model to nest two broad approaches to coalition formation, one based on cooperative game theory, the other based on noncooperative bargaining. Three themes that receive explicit emphasis are agent farsightedness, the description of equilibrium coalition structures, and the efficiency implications of the various theories.},

The purpose of the study was to evaluate the influence of a learning methodology based on gamification and cooperative work in peers, and in mixed and interdisciplinary teams on the emotional intelligence, learning strategies, and life goals that motivate university students to learn. The sample consisted of 102 students who took a subject with a gamification-based methodology, through the Mechanics-Dynamics-Aesthetics model, in a cooperative way. The Self-Perception Scale of Personal Academic Motivation and the Trait Meta Mood Scale 24 were used. The results of the study showed an increase in learning strategies and life goals that motivated university students to study, as well as increases in emotional clarity and significantly in emotional repair. It was concluded that gamification is a positive tool for its ability to increase emotional intelligence, life goals, and learning strategies in university students' motivation to learn.},

The open world assumption corresponds to the usual first order approach to query evaluation: Given a data base DB and a query Q, the only answers to Q are those which obtain from proofs of Q given DB as hypotheses. Under the closed world assumption, certain answers are admitted as a result of failure to find a proof. More specifically, if no proof of a positive ground literal exists, then the negation of that literal is assumed true.In this paper, we show that closed world evaluation of an arbitrary query may be reduced to open world evaluation of so-called atomic queries. We then show that the closed world assumption can lead to inconsistencies, but for Horn data bases no such inconsistencies can arise. Finally, we show how for Horn data bases under the closed world assumption purely negative clauses are irrelevant for deductive retrieval and function instead as integrity constraints.},

  abstract = {Due to the general gamification of our culture and society as well as the proliferation of games in our everyday activities, people are increasingly looking at games and gamification as a source for cooperation and other prosocial behaviors. However, not all game features lead to increased cohesion, cooperation or collaboration between people. While some games indeed are geared for cooperation, majority of games also aim toward competition or just non-social activity. Therefore, a prominent research problem exists in understanding how different game and gamification design may lead to altruistic sentiment and collective action. In this study, we investigated how the engagement with cooperative game features relates to the emergence of altruism and whether altruism leads to the formation of we-intentions in a gaming context. We employed data gathered among players of the augmented reality game Ingress (N=206) and analyzed the data using PLS-SEM. The results show that game features can give rise to altruism and that altruism can invoke we-intentions via cooperative goal structures (we-goals) of individuals. In addition to providing important insights regarding how cooperation emerges within games, this study provides implications for cultivating cooperation by gamification.},

  abstract = {Cooperation is in many ways a meaningful behavior and understanding how cooperation can be fostered among humans is integral to solving the many global challenges we are facing. Thus, one of the major current de\- velopments exists in exploring the potential of gamification to engage people in cooperative activity. However, while the literature on this phenomenon is growing in numbers, it remains unclear how gamification motivates cooperation and how effective it is in cooperative settings. This lack of understanding obstructs us from designing gamification that appropriately supports cooperation and from comprehending what potential hurdles need to be considered. We close this gap by theorizing a framework for gamifying cooperation. Guided by this framework, we systematically review and synthesize the existing literature (n = 51) to understand how gamification has been previously employed to motivate cooperation and what is known about the effects of gamification in cooperative contexts. The main contribution of the present study consists in deducing three different approaches (i.e., based on individualistic, cooperative, and hybrid use of features) to motivate cooperation by gamification and in providing a strategic platform for future research by proposing 11 agenda points regarding thematic, theoretical, and methodological future research avenues for gamifying cooperative activity.},

  abstract = {Although cyber threat intelligence (CTI) exchange is a theoretically useful technique for improving security of a society, the potential participants are often reluctant to share their CTI and prefer to consume only, at least in voluntary based approaches. Such behavior destroys the idea of information exchange. On the other hand, governments are forcing specific entities and operators to report them specific incidents depending on their impact, otherwise there could be sanctions to those operators which are not reporting them on time. Obligations and sanctions are usually discouraging participants to share information voluntarily which will just share and report what is strictly required. We propose a paradigm shift of cybersecurity information exchange by introducing a new way to encourage all participants involved, at all levels, to share relevant information dynamically. It will also contribute to the support and deployment of Dynamic Risk Management frameworks to keep risks under an acceptance level along the time. Participants will have new and specific incentives to share, invest and consume threat intelligence and risk intelligence information depending on their different roles (producers, consumers, investors, donors and owner). Our proposal leverages from standards like Structured Threat Information Exchange, as well as W3C semantic web standards to enable a workspace of knowledge related to behavioral threat intelligence patterning to characterize tactics, techniques and procedures. At the same time, we propose an Ethereum Blockchain Smart contract Marketplace to better incentivize the sharing of that knowledge between all parties involved as well as creating a standard CTI token as a digital asset with a promising value in the market. Simulations and an experimentation were performed to demonstrate its benefits and incentives, but also its potential limits with regard to storage and cost of transactions.},

The social emotional model presented in this paper uses individual emotions of each one of the entities, which are represented in the emotional space PAD. Using a social emotional model within intelligent entities allows the creation of more real simulations, in which emotional states can influence decision-making. The result of this social emotional mode is represented by a series of examples, which are intended to represent a number of situations in which the emotions of each individual modify the emotion of the group. Moreover, the paper introduces an example which employs the proposed model in order to learn and predict future actions trying to influence in the social emotion of a group of people.},

  abstract = {In recent years federated learning has emerged as a new paradigm for training machine learning models oriented to distributed systems. The main idea is that each node of a distributed system independently trains a model and shares only model parameters, such as weights, and does not share the training data set, which favors aspects such as security and privacy. Subsequently, and in a centralized way, a collective model is built that gathers all the information provided by all of the participating nodes. Several federated learning framework proposals have been developed that seek to optimize any aspect of the learning process. However, a lack of flexibility and dynamism is evident in many cases. In this regard, this study aims to provide flexibility and dynamism to the federated learning process. The methodology used consists of designing a multi-agent system that can form a federated learning framework where the agents act as nodes that can be easily added to the system dynamically. The proposal has been evaluated with different experiments on the SPADE platform; the results obtained demonstrate the benefits of the federated system while facilitating flexibility and scalability.},

The semantic relationships in the data are reflected by their relative distances in the map. Two different simulations, both based on a neural network model that implements the algorithm of the selforganizing feature maps, are given. For both, an essential, new ingredient is the inclusion of the contexts, in which each symbol appears, into the input data. This enables the network to detect the "logical similarity" between words from the statistics of their contexts. In the first demonstration, the context simply consists of a set of attribute values that occur in conjunction with the words. In the second demonstration, the context is defined by the sequences in which the words occur, without consideration of any associated attributes. Simple verbal statements consisting of nouns, verbs, and adverbs have been analyzed in this way. Such phrases or clauses involve some of the abstractions that appear in thinking, namely, the most common categories, into which the words are then automatically grouped in both of our simulations. We also argue that a similar process may be at work in the brain.},

This paper attempts to address both dimensions within a single unified framework, by bringing together probabilistic argumentation and reinforcement learning. We show how a probabilistic rule-based argumentation framework can capture Markov decision processes and reinforcement learning agents; and how the framework allows us to characterise agents and their argument-based motivations from both a logic-based perspective and a probabilistic perspective. We advocate and illustrate the use of our approach to capture models of agency and norms, and argue that, in addition to providing a novel method for investigating agent types, the unified framework offers a sound basis for taking a mentalistic approach to agent profiles.},

To advance our understanding of how people learn in MOOCs, we investigate the intersection between learning design and the temporal process of engagement in the course. This study investigates the detailed processes of engagement using educational process mining in a FutureLearn science course (N\,=\,2086 learners) and applying an established taxonomy of learning design to classify learning activities. The analyses were performed on three groups of learners categorised based upon their clicking behaviour. The process-mining results show at least one dominant pathway in each of the three groups, though multiple popular additional pathways were identified within each group. All three groups remained interested and engaged in the various learning and assessment activities. The findings from this study suggest that in the analysis of voluminous MOOC data there is value in first clustering learners and then investigating detailed progressions within each cluster that take the order and type of learning activities into account. The approach is promising because it provides insight into variation in behavioural sequences based on learners' intentions for earning a course certificate. These insights can inform the targeting of analytics-based interventions to support learners and inform MOOC designers about adapting learning activities to different groups of learners based on their goals.},

Despite diverse enrollments, most online courses adopt a onesize-fits-all design that presents the same learning activities to all learners. We studied how learning design can be adapted to improve learner persistence rate. We leveraged data from ten FutureLearn MOOCs (n = 49,582) to examine how variation in course activities, such as articles, videos, discussions and quizzes predicted learner persistence. We then assessed the heterogeneity in these associations by learners' geo-cultural and socioeconomic context. Our findings suggest that certain types of learning activities (e.g., discussion) facilitate progress for learners in one context (e.g., Anglo-Saxon), while inhibiting progress in another (e.g., South Asia). This research contributes new insights into the role of cultural variation in learning design preferences and can inform ongoing efforts to create online learning environments that are effective for learners from diverse backgrounds.},

However, the perception of learners regarding the role of different learning design elements in sustaining their engagement in the course is still unclear. Objectives: This study aimed to examine learners' perception of learning design elements in MOOCs and explore the ways in which these perceptions differ between geo-cultural contexts. Methods: We conducted interviews with 22 learners from seven geo-cultural regions to gather insights into their learning design preferences. Results: Our findings indicate that learners from regions such as South Asia exhibit a strong inclination towards video-based content and a lesser preference for reading textual resources. In contrast, learners from regions such as Anglo-Saxon demonstrate a high preference for reading texts such as articles and video transcripts. Conclusion: The observed variations in self-reported interests in various learning design elements raise intriguing questions about the nature and extent of participation of various geo-cultural groups. This study underscores the need to develop inclusive MOOC designs and implement learning analytics approaches that adapt to the cultural preferences of learners.},

  abstract = {Student intention and motivation are among the strongest predictors of persistence and completion in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), but these factors are typically measured through fixed-response items that constrain student expression. We use natural language processing techniques to evaluate whether text analysis of open responses questions about motivation and utility value can offer additional capacity to predict persistence and completion over and above information obtained from fixed-response items. Compared to simple benchmarks based on demographics, we find that a machine learning prediction model can learn from unstructured text to predict which students will complete an online course. We show that the model performs well out-of-sample, compared to a standard array of demographics. These results demonstrate the potential for natural language processing to contribute to predicting student success in MOOCs and other forms of open online learning.},

  abstract = {Chatbots are able to provide support to patients suffering from very different conditions. Patients with chronic diseases or comorbidities could benefit the most from chatbots which can keep track of their condition, provide specific information, encourage adherence to medication, etc. To perform these functions, chatbots need a suitable underlying software architecture. In this paper, we introduce a chatbot architecture for chronic patient support grounded on three pillars: scalability by means of microservices, standard data sharing models through HL7 FHIR and standard conversation modeling using AIML. We also propose an innovative automation mechanism to convert FHIR resources into AIML files, thus facilitating the interaction and data gathering of medical and personal information that ends up in patient health records. To align the way people interact with each other using messaging platforms with the chatbot architecture, we propose these very same channels for the chatbotpatient interaction, paying special attention to security and privacy issues. Finally, we present a monitored-data study performed in different chronic diseases, and we present a prototype implementation tailored for one specific chronic disease, psoriasis, showing how this new architecture allows the change, the addition or the improvement of different parts of the chatbot in a dynamic and flexible way, providing a substantial improvement in the development of chatbots used as virtual assistants for chronic patients.},

In particular, if we consider the subcategory of Serious Games in which the object of the game is to educate the user through the interactive discovery of real-life concepts (associated to Semantic Web resources), the inclusion of a semantic representation of the user profile and his contextual information becomes an important element to recommend the user more accurate concepts. This paper proposes and describes an ontology that allows the creation of Serious Games with those characteristics. The potential of the ontology is shown through two use cases: a serious, Web-based and question-based boardgame prototype and the Semantic Educloud project.},

  abstract = {There are many claims that gamification (i.e., using game elements outside games) impact decreases over time (i.e., the novelty effect). Most studies analyzing this effect focused on extrinsic game elements, while fictional and collaborative competition have been recently recommended. Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, no long-term research has been carried out with STEM learners from introductory programming courses (CS1), a context that demands encouraging practice and mitigating motivation throughout the semester. Therefore, the main goal of this work is to better understand how the impact of a gamification design, featuring fictional and competitive-collaborative elements, changes over a 14-week period of time, when applied to CS1 courses taken by STEM students (N = 756). In an ecological setting, we followed a 2x7 quasi-experimental design, where Brazilian STEM students completed assignments in either a gamified or non-gamified version of the same system, which provided the measures (number of attempts, usage time, and system access) to assess user behavior at seven points in time. Results indicate changes in gamification's impact that appear to follow a U-shaped pattern. Supporting the novelty effect, the gamification's effect started to decrease after four weeks, decrease that lasted between two to six weeks. Interestingly, the gamification's impact shifted to an uptrend between six and 10 weeks after the start of the intervention, partially recovering its contribution naturally. Thus, we found empirical evidence supporting that gamification likely suffers from the novelty effect, but also benefits from the familiarization effect, which contributes to an overall positive impact on students. These findings may provide some guidelines to inform practitioners about how long the initial contributions of gamification last, and how long they take to recover after some reduction in benefits. It can also help researchers to realize when to apply/evaluate interventions that use gamification by taking into consideration the novelty effect and, thereby, better understand the real impact of gamification on students' behavior in the long run.},

Self-organising applications dynamically change their functionality and structure without direct user intervention, responding to changes in requirements and the environment. This is the first book to offer an integrated view of self-organisation technologies applied to distributed systems, particularly focusing on multiagent systems. The editors developed this integrated book with three aims: to explain self-organisation concepts and principles, using clear definitions and a strong theoretical background; to examine how self-organising behaviour can be modelled, analysed and systematically engineered into agent behaviour; and to assess the types of problems that can be solved using self-organising multiagent systems. The book comprises chapters covering all three dimensions, synthesising up-to-date research work and the latest technologies and applications. The book offers dedicated chapters on concepts such as self-organisation, emergence in natural systems, software agents, stigmergy, gossip, cooperation and immune systems. The book then explains how to engineer artificial self-organising software, in particular it examines methodologies and middleware infrastructures. Finally, the book presents diverse applications of self-organising software, such as constraint satisfaction, trust management, image recognition and networking. The book will be of interest to researchers working on emergent phenomena and adaptive systems. It will also be suitable for use as a graduate textbook, with chapter summaries and exercises, and an accompanying website that includes teaching slides, exercise solutions and research project outlines.},

This paper presents a dialogue system that enables a human to engage in a dialogue with a software agent to reason about health-related issues in a home environment. The purpose of this work is to conduct a pilot evaluation study of a prototype system for human-agent dialogues, which is built upon a set of semantic models and integrated in a web application designed for older adults. Focus of the study was to receive qualitative results regarding purpose and content of the agent-based dialogue system, and to evaluate a method for the agent to evaluate its behavior based on the human agent's perception of appropriateness of moves. The participants include five therapists and 11 older adults. The results show users' feedback on the purpose of dialogues and the appropriateness of dialogues presented to them during the interaction with the software agent.},

In fact, scientific interest is on the rise and many avenues of research have been pursued, including studies in robotics, biology, sociology, and psychology. The most active field of research is computational intelligence, not least because of popular academic gaming competitions that feature Ms. Pac-Man. This paper summarizes the peer-reviewed research that focuses on either game (or close variants thereof) with particular emphasis on the field of computational intelligence. The potential usefulness of games like Pac-Man for higher education is also discussed and the paper concludes with a discussion of prospects for future work.},

These studies represented over 8 decades of research on over 17,000 early adolescents from 11 countries and 4 multinational samples. As predicted by social interdependence theory, results indicate that higher achievement and more positive peer relationships were associated with cooperative rather than competitive or individualistic goal structures.

  abstract = {The game of poker has been identified as a beneficial domain for current AI research because of the properties it possesses such as the need to deal with hidden information and stochasticity. The identification of poker as a useful research domain has inevitably resulted in increased attention from academic researchers who have pursued many separate avenues of research in the area of computer poker. The poker domain has often featured in previous review papers that focus on games in general, however a comprehensive review paper with a specific focus on computer poker has so far been lacking in the literature. In this paper, we present a review of recent algorithms and approaches in the area of computer poker, along with a survey of the autonomous poker agents that have resulted from this research. We begin with the first serious attempts to create strong computerised poker players by constructing knowledge-based and simulation-based systems. This is followed by the use of computational game theory to construct robust poker agents and the advances that have been made in this area. Approaches to constructing exploitive agents are reviewed and the challenging problems of creating accurate and dynamic opponent models are addressed. Finally, we conclude with a selection of alternative approaches that have received attention in previously published material and the interesting problems that they pose. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {In recent years, there has been a lot of attention given to the trend of including game elements into non-gaming facilities. The usage of gamification in education is a massive benefit for motivation, user interaction, and social effects. The gamified elements such as points, badge, feedbacks, level, rewards, challenges, etc. have been used in e-learning. A systematic review of gamification in online education has not been found when the relevant literature examined. Therefore, this study aims to research the current literature using gamification and online education and highlight the reported benefits and challenges of gamification applications in online education. The present research followed the literature review method. The current study employed a qualitative approach for collected data. Thus, the term "gamification" was used as the primary research keyword. The results show that gamification has increasingly been accepted as a useful learning tool to generate more engaging educational environments. Additionally, elements support and motivate students to participate in a gamification system. The study showed that the most common gamification elements used in e-learning and have a powerful effect on the students are points, leaderboards, badge, and level. This study is thought to contribute significantly to studies on the use of gamification applications in online education. It reinforces previous studies and identifies many useful study topics that can be explored to advance the field. From these results, suggestions on gamification applications in e-learning for further research are given.},

  abstract = {The advancement in technology indicates that there is an opportunity to enhance human--computer interaction by way of affective state recognition. Affective state recognition is typically based on passive stimuli such as watching video clips, which does not reflect genuine interaction. This paper presents a study on affective state recognition using active stimuli, i.e. facial expressions of users when they attempt computerised tasks, particularly across typical usage of computer systems. A data collection experiment is presented for acquiring data from normal users whilst they interact with software, attempting to complete a set of predefined tasks. In addition, a hierarchical machine learning approach is presented for facial expression-based affective state recognition, which employs an Euclidean distance-based feature representation, conjointly with a customised encoding for users' self-reported affective states. Consequently, the aim is to find the potential relationship between the facial expressions, as defined by Paul Ekman, and the self-reported emotional states specified by users using Russells Circumplex model, in relation to the actual feelings and affective states. The main findings of this study suggest that facial expressions cannot precisely reveal the actual feelings of users whilst interacting with common computerised tasks. Moreover, during active interaction tasks more variation occurs within the facial expressions of participants than occurs within passive interaction.},

  abstract = {In the last few years, deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) has become a highly active area of research. A particularly challenging class of problems in this area is partially observable, cooperative, multi-agent learning, in which teams of agents must learn to coordinate their behaviour while conditioning only on their private observations. This is an attractive research area since such problems are relevant to a large number of real-world systems and are also more amenable to evaluation than general-sum problems. Standardised environments such as the ALE and MuJoCo have allowed single-agent RL to move beyond toy domains, such as grid worlds. However, there is no comparable benchmark for cooperative multi-agent RL. As a result, most papers in this field use one-off toy problems, making it difficult to measure real progress. In this paper, we propose the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) as a benchmark problem to fill this gap. SMAC is based on the popular real-time strategy game StarCraft II and focuses on micromanagement challenges where each unit is controlled by an independent agent that must act based on local observations. We offer a diverse set of challenge maps and recommendations for best practices in benchmarking and evaluations. We also open-source a deep multi-agent RL learning framework including state-of-the-art algorithms. We believe that SMAC can provide a standard benchmark environment for years to come. Videos of our best agents for several SMAC scenarios are available at: https://youtu.be/VZ7zmQ\_obZ0.},

We also describe efficient ways of applying these mobile models to object detection in a novel framework we call SSDLite. Additionally, we demonstrate how to build mobile semantic segmentation models through a reduced form of DeepLabv3 which we call Mobile DeepLabv3. The MobileNetV2 architecture is based on an inverted residual structure where the input and output of the residual block are thin bottleneck layers opposite to traditional residual models which use expanded representations in the input an MobileNetV2 uses lightweight depthwise convolutions to filter features in the intermediate expansion layer. Additionally, we find that it is important to remove non-linearities in the narrow layers in order to maintain representational power. We demonstrate that this improves performance and provide an intuition that led to this design. Finally, our approach allows decoupling of the input/output domains from the expressiveness of the transformation, which provides a convenient framework for further analysis. We measure our performance on Imagenet classification, COCO object detection, VOC image segmentation. We evaluate the trade-offs between accuracy, and number of operations measured by multiply-adds (MAdd), as well as the number of parameters},

While many agent-based models have been proposed for logistics management, most of these models use an auction approach. Thus, they are not suitable for intra-organizational logistics management. In this paper, we first formulate logistics management as a distributed resource allocation problem. Then, we present our ongoing work on developing a multi-agent model for intra-organizational logistics management and using Lagrangian relaxation to decompose the problem into a set of subproblems. Our initial experimental results are very promising. We provide a detailed analysis of our results. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

  abstract = {Gamification is a relatively new trend that focuses on applying game mechanics to non-game contexts in order to engage audiences and to inject a little fun into mundane activities besides generating motivational and cognitive benefits. While many fields such as Business, Marketing and e-Learning have taken advantage of the potential of gamification, the digital healthcare domain has also started to exploit this emerging trend. This paper aims to summarize the current knowledge regarding gamified e-Health applications. A systematic literature review was therefore conducted to explore the various gamification strategies employed in e-Health and to address the benefits and the pitfalls of this emerging discipline. A total of 46 studies from multiple sources were then considered and thoroughly investigated. The results show that the majority of the papers selected reported gamification and serious gaming in health and wellness contexts related specifically to chronic disease rehabilitation, physical activity and mental health. Although gamification in e-Health has attracted a great deal of attention during the last few years, there is still a dearth of valid empirical evidence in this field. Moreover, most of the e-Health applications and serious games investigated have been proven to yield solely short-term engagement through extrinsic rewards. For gamification to reach its full potential, it is therefore necessary to build e-Health solutions on well-founded theories that exploit the core experience and psychological effects of game mechanics.},

Such creative ML approaches have seen wide use in the domains of visual art and music for applications such as image and music generation and style transfer. However, similar creative ML techniques have not been as widely adopted in the domain of game design despite the emergence of ML-based methods for generating game content. In this paper, we argue for leveraging and repurposing such creative techniques for designing content for games, referring to these as approaches for Game Design via Creative ML (GDCML). We highlight existing systems that enable GDCML and illustrate how creative ML can inform new systems via example applications and a proposed system.},

  abstract = {Challenges arise when the size of a group of cooperating agents is scaled to hundreds or thousands of members. In domains such as space exploration, military and disaster response, groups of this size (or larger) are required to achieve extremely complex, distributed goals. To effectively and efficiently achieve their goals, members of a group need to cohesively follow a joint course of action while remaining flexible to unforeseen developments in the environment. Coordination of Large-Scale Multiagent Systems provides extensive coverage of the latest research and novel solutions being developed in the field. It describes specific systems, such as SERSE and WIZER, as well as general approaches based on game theory, optimization and other more theoretical frameworks. The book is comprised of several distinct topic areas, addressing: Effects of Scaling Coordination The Effects of Locality and Asymmetry in Large-Scale Multiagent MDPs A Study of Scalability Properties in Robotic Teams Comparing Three Approaches to Large-Scale Coordination Scaling Existing Coordination Approaches Decentralized Partner Finding in Multi-Agent Systems Distributed Coordination of an Agent Society Based on Obligations and Commitments to Negotiated Agreements A Family of Graphical-Game-Based Algorithms for Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems Key-Based Coordination Strategies: Scalability Issues Designing Agent Utilities for Coordinated, Scalable and Robust Multi-Agent Systems New Approaches for Large Scale Coordination Learning Scalable Coaltion Formation in an Organizational Content Multi-Agent Coordination in Open Environments Mobile Agents WIZER: Automated Model Improvement in Multi-Agent Social-Network Systems Robustness and Flexibility in Large-Scale Multi-Agent Systems Handling Coordination Failures in Large-Scale Multi-Agent Systems Towards Flexible Coordination of Large Scale Multi-Agent Teams Techniques for Robust Planning in Degradable Multiagent Systems This volume will be of interest to researchers in academia and industry, as well as advanced-level students.

  abstract = {Wiki sustavi, progresivna tehnologija kojoj u njezinim po\v cecima neki poznati stru\v cnjaci nisu predvidjeli svijetlu budu\'cnost, danas su u \v sirokoj upotrebi. Sustavi koji svakom prido\v slici omogu\'cavaju da na njima ostavi traga, razvijaju se autopoieti\v cno u sve impresivnije i impresivnije repozitorije znanja. Mo\v zda najpoznatiji primjer takvog sustava, Wikipedia, otvorena enciklopedija Interneta u vrijeme pisanja ovog teksta u svojoj engleskoj ina\v cici broji preko 2.2 milijuna \v clanaka, koje su ljudi \v sirom svijeta postavili na sustav, a postoje ina\v cice za gotovo sve svjetske jezike. Ipak, \v cini se da su wiki sustavi do\v sli do svoje granice rasta. Sve je \v ce\v s\'ce i \v ce\v s\'ce slu\v caj da se na razli\v citim sustavima poku\v savaju definirati pravila pona\v sanja, pravila organiziranja znanja, pravila dodavanja metapodataka primarno u svrhu jednostavnijega pretra\v zivanja i izvo\dj enja zaklju\v caka iz ovih ogromnih repozitorija (uglavnom) tekstualnih podataka. Napori poput semanti\v ckih wiki sustava, koji u tradicionalne (obi\v cne) wiki sustave poku\v savaju dodati semanti\v cku komponentu \v cini se u potpunosti zanemaruju jedan od osnovnih razloga nevjerojatnog uspjeha ove vrste sustava. Wiki sustavi su jednostavni za kori\v stenje i stoga ih koristi \v sirok spektar ljudi. Korisnici imaju vrlo razli\v cita shva\'canja tehnologije koja variraju od vrhunskih stru\v cnjaka za informacijsku tehnologiju do laika. Dakako, da distribucija korisnika naginje onima manje vi\v cnim informacijskim tehnologijama. Upravo zbog toga uvo\dj enje naprednih koncepata poput semanti\v ckih tehnologija uvelike ograni\v cava primjenjivost takvih sustava jer od obi\v cnih korisnika tra\v zi relativno dobro poznavanje takvih tehnologija. Kao \v sto je prethodno napomenuto, wiki sustavi razvijaju se autopoieti\v cno, za razliku od tradicionalnih alopoieti\v cnih (tehni\v ckih) informacijskih tehnologija. Autopoiesis o\v citava se upravo u \v cinjenici da korisnici svojim sudjelovanjem na sustavu stvaraju taj sustav, \v sire ga, unaprije\dj uju ga novim i novima sadr\v zajima, pravilima i definicijama. Postavlja se pitanje je li mogu\'ce koncept semanti\v ckog weba "ugraditi" u wiki sustave, a da se pri tome zadr\v zi njihova po\v cetna jednostavnost? Jedna druga vrsta suvremenih Web 2.0 sustava na koje \v zelimo ovdje ukazati su sustavi za dru\v stveno ozna\v cavanje (engl. social tagging). Oni su danas sve \v ce\v s\'ce u upotrebi, a koriste upravo organizaciji znanja pojedinog korisnika (engl. personal information management - PIM; personal knowledge management - PKM). Takvi sustavi svojim korisnicima omogu\'cavaju da postavljaju oznake (engl. tag) na bilo koji sadr\v zaj na koji nailaze na webu. Impresivni su takvi sustavi iz perspektive pretra\v zivanja. Naime dok poznate tra\v zilice pretra\v zuju web naprednim algoritmima, sustavi za dru\v stveno ozna\v cavanje koriste jednostavno oznake koje su postavili korisnici. Sustavi za dru\v stveno ozna\v cavanje \v cesto pronalaze relevantnije podatke od naprednih tra\v zilica jer dolazi to tzv. Delfi efekta prema kojem je prosje\v cno mi\v sljenje nekog podskupa ljudi bolji prediktor od mi\v sljenja jedne nasumice odabrane osobe. Jo\v s jedno pitanje koje ovdje valja postaviti jest pitanje suvremenih organizacija i posebice njihovih informacijskih sustava. Suvremene organizacije danas su otvorene, adaptibilne, heterarhijske i virtualne. Je li mogu\'ce iskoristiti suvremene informacijske tehnologije kako bi se podr\v zale potrebe suvremenih organizacija za adaptibilno\v s\'cu, otvoreno\v s\'cu, heterarhiji i virtualno\v s\'cu? U ovom \'cemo radu poku\v salo se, pa makar djelomi\v cno, odgovoriti i na to pitanje, na koje suvremeni (rigidni, alopoietski postavljeni) informacijski sustavi ne daju odgovor. Web usluge (engl. web services) danas su na\v cin na koji je putem mre\v ze mogu\'ce koristiti usluge raznih organizacija. Semanti\v ckim opisom takvih usluga poku\v sava se omogu\'citi automatizirano ra\v cunalno kori\v stenje takvih usluga. Je li integracijom ove tehnologije i gore navedenih mogu\'ce podr\v zati potrebe suvremenih organizacija? U ovom radu krenulo se pristupom objektno-orijentiranog semanti\v ckog modeliranja te su tako dobivena saznanja stavljena u autopoieti\v cni kontekst. Osnovni ciljevi bili su: (1) da sustav autopoieti\v cno generira formalizirano znanje nad kojim se mo\v ze ra\v cunalno rezonirati, (2) od prosje\v cnog korisnika o\v cekuje se nikakvo ili minimalno poznavanje semanti\v ckih tehnologija, (3) sustav se treba autopoieti\v cno razvijati kako na podru\v cju vlastitog sadr\v zaja tako i na podru\v cju vlastite funkcionalnosti (za razliku od tradicionalnih wiki sustava koji se razvijaju u pravilu isklju\v civo na podru\v cju sadr\v zaja). Pretpostavljeno je da je svijet kojeg korisnici na sustavu opisuju jedan skup objekata koji su u me\dj usobnim relacijama i raznim interakcijama. Mo\v ze se re\'ci da je "osnovna jedinica" sustava objekt. Svaki objekt potencijalno ima svoje relacije s drugim objektima i niz metoda kojima reagira na podra\v zaje (poruke) od drugih objekata. Relacije se ponekad u kontekstu objektno-orijentiranog pristupa nazivaju i atributima radi jednostavnosti implementacije iako je rije\v c o relaciji sadr\v zavanja. U radu je tako\dj er primjenjen takav pristup radi jednostavnosti te se atributima smatraju objekti koji su jednostavni znakovni nizovi dok \'ce svi ostali objekti biti vezani relacijama. Podskupove skupa svih objekata nazivamo ekstenzijom nekog koncepta ukoliko postoji jasna intenzija (definicija, pravilo) koncepta po kojem jednozna\v cno mo\v zemo svaki objekt klasificirati bilo kao \v clana ekstenzije koncepta, bilo kao \v clana komplementarnog skupa ekstenziji. Koncepti se jo\v s nazivaju tipovima ili klasama te \'cemo ta tri naziva u daljnjem razmatranju smatrati sinonimima. Mo\v zemo re\'ci da se svaki koncept sastoji od svoje intenzije (definicije), ekstenzije (skupa svih objekata na koje je koncept primjenjiv) i svog simbola (oznakom kojom ozna\v cavamo taj specifi\v cni koncept). Ako se promotri wiki sustav iz perspektive semanti\v ckog modeliranja mo\v ze se re\'ci da postoje tri osnovna koncepta na kojima je mogu\'ce temeljiti razmatranje, a to su: (1) stranica, (2) osoba i (3) wiki sustav (koji uklju\v cuje sam sustav, sve njegove \v clanke odnosno stranice i korisnike). Uvedena je sljede\'ca pretpostavku: neka je svaki objekt tipa stranica generi\v cki objekt (u kontekstu modeliranja znanja \v cesto ozna\v cen simbolom Thing). Neka sada svaki korisnik sustava mo\v ze ozna\v cavati stranice na sustavu postavljaju\'ci oznake u obliku ure\dj enih parova atribut:vrijednost. Na taj na\v cin korisnici specijaliziraju svaki generi\v cki objekt u neku (novu) klasu objekata. Tako\dj er, neka. atribut i vrijednost mogu biti i neka od klju\v cnih rije\v ci poput class, inherits, relation, rule i sl. poznatih iz objektno-orijentiranih programskih jezika. Na taj na\v cin korisnik potencijalno mo\v ze jo\v s u\v ze specijalizirati svoje mi\v sljenje (znanje) o stranici (objektu). Na taj je na\v cin podr\v zano dodavanje atributa pojedinom objektu kao i njegovo odre\dj ivanje koje se ti\v ce klase u koju pripada. Primjerice ako neki korisnik na neku stranicu postavi oznaku class:avion to zna\v ci da taj korisnik tu stranicu vi\v se ne smatra \v clankom ve\'c opisnikom objekta, tipa. "avion". Tako\dj er, svaki korisnik mo\v ze i potvrditi postoje\'cu oznaku \v cime se vjerodostojnost oznake pove\'cava. Wiki sustavi po svojoj standardnoj sintaksi omogu\'cavaju povezivanje svake stranice s drugim stranicama kako na samom sustavu tako i izvan njega, putem hiperveza. Mo\v zemo re\'ci da je ovdje rije\v c o relacijama s drugim objektima. Pretpostavlja se dakle da svaki korisnik mo\v ze na svaku stranicu dodavati hiperveze na druge stranice u obliku relacija. : naziv\_objekta pri \v cemu mo\v ze biti rije\v c o stranicama na samom sustavu (koje su onda tipa stranica ili nekog specijaliziranijeg tipa) ili eksternim stranicama (pri \v cemu uvodimo tip external resource). Neka, tako\dj er svaki korisnik mo\v ze potvrditi vezu kao i kod atributa odnosno ozna\v cavanja \v cime se vjerodostojnost relacije pove\'cava. Pretpostavlja se nadalje da svaki korisnik mo\v ze svakoj stranici nadodati web uslugu ili neku drugu vrstu skriptne ekstenzije koja pro\v siruje funkcionalnost stranice te takve dodatke nazivamo metodama. Neka je svaka takva metoda semanti\v cki opisana pomo\'cu standardnog obrasca i svog opisnika (primjerice engl. WSDL - Web Service Definition Language). Svaka se metoda, kao i u prethodna dva slu\v caja mo\v ze potvrditi od drugih korisnika, \v cime se pove\'cava njezina vjerodostojnost. Zaklju\v cno mo\v zemo re\'ci da smo ovako koncipiranim sustavom u stanju podr\v zati dinami\v cno kreiranje klasa, objekata, njihovih atributa, metoda i relacija. Konkretno, moglo bi se re\'ci daje rije\v c o dinami\v cki kreiranoj ontologiji, dakle formalizaciji odre\dj ene aplikacijske domene. Pozabavimo se sada vjerodostojno\v s\'cu (istinito\v s\'cu) informacija koje korisnici pospremaju u sustav. Kako bi to u\v cinili potrebno je prethodno opisati koncept organizacije ribarske mre\v ze kao i mogu\'cnosti podr\v zavanja takvog koncepta informacijskom tehnologijom. Rije\v c je o konceptu koji poku\v sava iskoristiti najbolje od dvaju poznatih koncepata iz organizacijske teorije, hijerarhije i heterarhije odnosno mre\v zne strukture. Ako promatramo ribarsku mre\v zu na obali ona se \v cini potpuno heterarhijskom, svi su \v cvorovi istovjetni i na jednakoj razini. No primimo li jedan \v cvor i uzdignemo ga dinami\v cki oko njega nastaje hijerarhija pri \v cemu je odabrani \v cvor na vrhu. Primimo li drugi nastaje druga itd. Na taj na\v cin dinami\v cki mo\v zemo stvarati nove i uni\v stavati stare hijerarhije. Postavlja se pitanje kako podr\v zati takav koncept informacijskom tehnologijom. Pretpostavimo da imamo sustav na kojem se vodi niz projekata neke organizacije (ili op\'cenito nekog socijalnog sustava) pri \v cemu svaki projekt ima svoj vlastiti autopoieti\v cni semanti\v cki wiki sustav. Moglo bi se re\'ci da svaki projekt definira svojevrsnu aplikacijsku domenu. Sama funkcionalnost tog sustava u ovom trenutku nam nije bitna, nego nam je bitan mehanizam kojim \'cemo prona\'ci najadakvatniju osobu za pojedini projekt koja se svojim znanjima i sposobnostima isti\v ce te time postaje vo\dj a. Kako bi objasnili taj mehanizam potrebno je objasniti PageRank algoritam kojeg koristi poznata tra\v zilica Google pri rangiranju stranica koje se pretra\v zuju. Algoritam analizira web stranice broje\'ci ulazne i izlazne veze svake stranice. Svaka veza koju neka stranica ima prema nekoj drugoj stranici smatra se glasom potpore te stranice za stranicu na koju pokazuje. Sve se stranice inicijalno postavljaju na odre\dj eni rank koji je jednak 1/N pri \v cemu je N broj stranica koje se analiziraju. Ako neka stranica kojim slu\v cajem pokazuje na vi\v se stranica tada se njezin glas dijeli tako da svaka stranica dobiva n-ti dio njezinoga glasa (ako je n broj stranica na koje stranica pokazuje). Sada se do odre\dj ene preciznosti analizira tako postavljena mre\v za stranica zbrajanjem ulaznih veza svake stranice i proslje\dj ivanjem novih vrijednosti na druge stranice. Na taj na\v cin dobije se rank za svaku stranicu, ta \v sto je on ve\'ci to ta stranica ima ve\'cu "potporu" drugih stranica. Taj se rank mo\v ze nazvati i vjerojatno\v s\'cu kojom \'ce neki korisnik nasumice obilaze\'ci stranice u zadanoj mre\v zi odabrati upravo zadanu stranicu. Page rank mre\v za ustvari predstavlja Markovljev lanac u kojem su stranice stanja, a tranzicije (koje su sve jednako vjerojatne) veze izme\dj u tih stranica. Postavimo sad taj algoritam u kontekst jedne socijalne mre\v ze, dakle mre\v ze ljudi, odnosno konkretno mre\v ze \v clanova nekog projekta ili aplikacijske domene. Dajemo svim \v clanovima projekta mogu\'cnost da glasuju za druge korisnike za koje smatraju da su najadekvatniji za vo\dj u projekta. Ako sada glasove promatramo kao veze na druge stranice tada primjenom PageRank algoritma dinami\v cki dobivamo hijerarhiju \v clanova na odre\dj enom projektu. Uvi\v sestru\v cavanjem ovog algoritma (stoga i vi\v se razli\v citih projekata) u stvari podr\v zavamo koncept ribarske mre\v ze. PageRank algoritam ima jo\v s jednu zanimljivu odliku koju \'cemo primijeniti u daljnjem izlaganju. Naime, zbroj svih rankova svih \v cvorova u mre\v zi je jednak 1 \v sto je dakako korisno u kontekstu teorije vjerojatnosti. Vratimo se sada na istinitost pojedinih informacija u autopoieti\v cnom semanti\v ckom wikiju. Pretpostavimo da je svaka oznaka koju neki korisnik postavi ponderirana njegovim rankom. Ovakav je ponder opravdan jer rank na neki na\v cin iskazuje uvjerenje drugih \v clanova da \'ce doti\v cni \v clan u\v ciniti pravu stvar, \v sto lako mo\v zemo povezati s definicijom znanja: "Znanje je istinito vjerovanje". Oznake se akumuliraju, dakle svaka se oznaka mo\v ze postaviti i vi\v se puta od razli\v citih \v clanova. Zbrajanjem pondera dobivamo vjerojatnost koja iskazuje uvjerenje \v clanova projekta da je informacija to\v cna. Sada kad imamo broj\v cani iznos vjerojatnosti mo\v zemo i logi\v cki formalizirati znanje u tako dinami\v cki kreiranoj ontologiji. Jasno je da ontologiju mo\v zemo opisati nekim od jezika, za ontologije (npr. F-Logika - engl. frame logic, f-logic, Deskripcijska Logika - engl. description logic) pri \v cemu se na ovom mjestu odlu\v cujemo za logiku temeljenu na okvirima odnosno F-Logiku. Potrebno je za odabrani jezik izvesti shemu anotacije vjerojatnosti \v sto \'ce biti u\v cinjeno u radu. No, \v sto je u slu\v caju ako zaklju\v cke \v zelimo izvoditi iz vi\v se razli\v citih ontologija, \v sto je opravdano pitanje. Naime, ako kao \v sto smo pretpostavili imamo niz projekata na kojima se dinami\v cki stvaraju ontologije tada je visoka vjerojatnost da \'ce nam ponekad biti potrebno znanje iz vi\v se razli\v citih podru\v cja. Primjerice, recimo da se jedan projekt bavi vinima, drugi receptima i tre\'ci gastronomskom ponudom nekog podru\v cja. Vrlo jednostavno mo\v ze se dogoditi da netko postavi upit "U kojem restoranu mogu popiti vino koje najbolje ide uz odre\dj enu vrstu ribe, a da pri tome ne platim vi\v se od 200 kn?" Agent koji poku\v sava odgovoriti na to pitanje mora prvo prona\'ci nazive recepata koji sadr\v ze tu odre\dj enu vrstu ribe, zatim mora prona\'ci vina koja idu uz navedene recepte i na kraju pretra\v ziti restorane koji neku od kombinacija imaju u svojoj gastronomskoj ponudi uz odgovaraju\'cu cijenu. Za spajanje razli\v citih izvora znanja postoji princip amalgamacije izvora znanja. U radu bi se taj koncept poku\v sao primijeniti na ovako na\v cinjen sustav ponderiranjem vjerojatnosti pojedinih izraza s izvedenicom broja \v clanova na pojedinom projektu. U ovom radu izvedena je formalizacija koja povezuje wiki sustave, semanti\v cki web, mre\v zne usluge, dru\v stveno ozna\v cavavanje i socijalne mre\v ze. Uz to opisan je i jedan jezik iz koji je nazvan Niklas (prema poznatom Niklasu Luhmanu koji je prvi uveo pojam autopoiesisa u dru\v stvene znanosti). Konkretno, istra\v zene su mogu\'cnosti primjene dobro formaliziranih koncepata iz semanti\v ckog weba i semanti\v ckih mre\v znih usluga u autopoieti\v cnom kontekstu wiki sustava uz pripomo\'c dru\v stvenog ozna\v cavanja i socijalnih mre\v za kao \v sto je prethodno opisano. Prvo su obja\v snjeni i formalizirani jezici za (obi\v cne) wiki sustave. U tom kontekstu bilo je potrebno opisati niz formalizacija sintakse koje se u takvim jezicima koriste poput hiperveza, slika i raznih drugih dodataka, poglavlja, formatiranja teksta, tablica, varijabli i predlo\v zaka. Nakon formalizacije jezika za wiki sustave opisani su jezici za semanti\v cke wiki sustave koji su odre\dj eno pro\v sirenje prethodno opisanih jezika. U tu svrhu bilo je potrebno opisati i formalizirati sintaksu i konkretno koncepte poput atributa i relacija, konverzija, semanti\v ckih predlo\v zaka i mre\v znih usluga. Pri tome se koristila logika, temeljena na okvirima (F-logika) kao jezik za formalizaciju. Na kraju su semanti\v cki wiki sustavi stavljeni u autopoieti\v cni kontekst. Bilo je potrebno izvesti anotaciju vjerojatnosti na prethodno definirane jezike obzirom na socijalnu mre\v zu kao i amalgamacijsku shemu kako bi se omogu\'cila integracija izvora znanja. Na kraju je prikazan niz primjera mogu\'cih autopoieti\v cnih aplikacija kako bi se poduprla teza o korisnosti prethodno izvedene formalizacije. Najva\v zniji primjer jest konstrukcija autopoieti\v cnog sustava za sigurnost osobnih ra\v cunala. Osnovna ideja je izgraditi autopoieti\v cni semanti\v cki wiki sustav o osnovnim prijetnjama osobnim ra\v cunalima (poznatih pogre\v saka) te ih povezati s potrebnim zakrpama. Na taj na\v cin bi se omogu\'cila svojevrsna baza znanja o prijetnjama i rje\v senjima te time i razvoj aplikacija za kori\v stenje takve baze. Uz navedeni prikazani su i sustav za autopoieti\v cnu znanstvenu konferenciju ili \v casopis te autopoieti\v cni sustav za upravljanje znanjem u organizaciji. Glavni cilj ovog istra\v zivanja bio je na jednom mjestu ukazati na teoriju i primjenu autopoiesisa u informacijskim znanostima s posebnim naglaskom na korisnost druk\v cijeg pristupa semanti\v ckim wiki sustavima. Htjelo se pokazati da su wiki sustavi u na\v celu autopoieti\v cni zbog svoje jednostavnosti kori\v stenja od strane dru\v stvenog sustava koji ih okru\v zuje, a ta se jednostavnost gubi uvo\dj enjem kompleksnih semanti\v ckih tehnologija. Svojevrsnim skrivanjem semanti\v ckih tehnologija u pozadinu sustava te uvo\dj enjem drugih dru\v stvenih tehnologija poput dru\v stvenog ozna\v cavanja i dru\v stvenih mre\v za poku\v sao se dokinuti taj jaz izme\dj u semanti\v ckih tehnologija i wiki sustava. Hipoteze ovog istra\v zivanja, koje su u radu i potvr\dj ene, bile su sljede\'ce: HIPOTEZA 1. Na temelju formalizacije jezika, za wiki sustave i jezika za semanti\v cke wiki sustave te uvo\dj enja koncepta organizacije ribarske mre\v ze mogu\'ce je izvesti anotacijsku shemu vjerojatnosti u takve jezike po uzoru na druge logi\v cke programske jezike. Anotacijska shema izvedena je uz pomo\'c sintaske logike temeljene na okvirima. HIPOTEZA 2. Na temelju sheme za anotaciju vjerojatnosti u jezike za semanti\v cke wiki sustave te na temelju uvo\dj enja analize dru\v stvenih mre\v za u wiki sustave i semanti\v cke wiki sustave mogu\'ce je izvesti amalgamacijsku shemu za takve jezike po uzoru na druge logi\v cke programske jezike. Amalgamaeijska shema izvedena je uz pomo\'c integracije dru\v stvenih mre\v za. HIPOTEZA 3. Na temelju sheme za anotaciju vjerojatnosti i sheme za amalgamaciju mogu\'ce je izvesti novu vrstu jezika za autopoieti\v cne semanti\v cke wiki sustave. Pri tome je formalizirana sintaksa i semantika novog jezika koji je svojevrsna kombinacija anotirane i amalgamirane logike temeljene na okvirima i prikaznih jezika za wiki sustave. Iz navedenog jasno je da se znanstveni doprinos ovog rada sastoji od eksplicitne formalizacije (obi\v cnih) wiki sustava, formalizacije jezika za semanti\v cke wiki sustave, uvo\dj enja semanti\v ckih mre\v znih usluga u semanti\v cke wiki sustave te uvo\dj enja objektno orijentiranog pristupa u formalizaciju jezika za semanti\v cke wiki sustave. Osnovni doprinos ogledava se u razvoju novog jezika za autopoieti\v cne semanti\v cke wiki sustave uvo\dj enjem koncepata dobivenih iz dru\v stvenog ozna\v cavanja i analizom socijalnih mre\v za odnosno konkretno uvo\dj enjem anotacije tako dobivenih vjerojatnosti i odgovaraju\'ce amalgamacijske sheme te na kraju primjene koncepta autopoiesisa u kontekstu informacijskih sustava. Uz navedeno opisana je jedna implementacija takvog jezika utjelovljena u jeziku niKlas. Iz dru\v stvene perspektive otvara se \v citav niz mogu\'cnosti za razvoj novih vrsta aplikacija temeljenih na podr\v zavanju autopoiesisa dru\v stvenog sustava. Naime, krajnji proizvod tj. aplikacija TAOPIS koja podr\v zava autopoieti\v cne semanti\v cke wiki sustave razvija se prema na\v celima paradigme otvorenog koda i dana je zajednici na besplatno kori\v stenje.},

This lecture will focus on social and semantic networks' data which provide interesting insights into the our world. The lecture will tackle some of the important data collection challenges on the Web (semistructured data, XPath as a semistructured data query language, AJAX and the client-side content generation problem, various API-s, etc.), tools and technologies which allow for automated and semiautomated data collection (Scrapy, XPather, Selenium, Needlebase, etc.), and provide some formal models useful for data analysis (tripartite ontology model - folksonomy, network matrices, logic programming). A practical example of a Web mining project regarding the analysis of the Croatian scientific bibliography as a Web 3.0 system will be presented in the end.},

In this paper, the concept of organizational architecture is firstly formalized using the fractal principle and then applied to multi-agent systems' (MAS) organizations. Objectives: Providing a holistic framework for modeling all aspects of MAS reorganization. Methods/Approach: MAS organizations are formalized using graph theory- and a new active graph rewriting formalism inspired by active database theory is introduced. Results: The newly developed framework is graphical, event-driven and applicable in a distributed MAS environment. Conclusions: By defining organizational units, processes, strategies and cultural artefacts in a recursive way, it is shown that labeled graphs and hypergraphs can be used to model various levels of organizational architecture while active graph grammars allow one to model reorganization of each of the architectural perspectives.},

  abstract = {Computing in the Internet of Things is increasingly pervasive, with everyday items including clothes, smart-phones, cars and various household appliances gaining sophisticated communication and computing capacities. It seems to be just a matter of time before devices have to collaborate and compete mutually as well as with their users, in order to provide better services to mankind. These embedded computers are increasingly autonomous and connected, and can thus be modeled as agents within multi-agent systems (MAS). Only 30 years ago it was science fiction that over a billion of people will exchange billions of e-mails on a daily basis. Today a scenario of millions of collaborating agents embedded in gadgets and appliances, across various networks may also sound futuristic. However given the current rate of development in electronics, we will soon have to manage large scale MAS (LSMAS) where millions of agents exist, collaborate and compete with each other. While a recent study shows that there are at least 50 organizational structure, superstructure and architecture types employed in modern organizations, there is a lack of research that would apply organizational design methods to organizations composed entirely of agents and agent systems in order to achieve alignment of organizational structure, processes, and reward system with the goals and strategy of the organization. Our research is therefore aimed towards enriching formal design methods for the development of LSMAS to foster the development of self-organizing and adaptable networks of devices that will contribute towards a sustainable development of the information society. In this work-in-progress study we apply a collaborative semantic wiki approach towards formalizing organizational design techniques in order to provide a foundation for future studies of automated LSMAS development.},

  abstract = {Massively Multi-Player On-Line Role-Playing Games (MMORPG) give us the opportunity to study two important aspects of computing: (1) large-scale virtual social interaction of people (players) and (2) the design, development and coordination of large-scale distributed artificial inteligence (AI). A common denominator for both aspects are the methods used to study them: social interaction can be descibed and simulated using agent-based models (ABM) whilst distributed AI is commonly modelled in terms of multi-agent systems (MAS). The important question to ask in both perspectives is how do agents organize in order to perform their tasks and reach their objectives? In the following paper we will present and overview of agent-based approaches to modeling MMORPG's agents including human players, artificial players (bots) and non-playing characters (NPCs). We will put a special accent on useful agent behaviours, coordination and consensus mechanisms as well as organization and social network structure of agent societies.},

  abstract = {The social web or web 2.0 has become the biggest and most accessible repository of data about human (social) behavior in history. Due to a knowledge gap between big data analytics and established social science methodology, this enormous source of information, has yet to be exploited for new and interesting studies in various social and humanities related fields. To make one step towards closing this gap, we provide a detailed step-by-step tutorial on some of the most important web mining and analytics methods on a real-world study of Croatia's biggest political blogging site. The tutorial covers methods for data retrieval, data conversion, cleansing and organization, data analysis (natural language processing, social and conceptual network analysis) as well as data visualization and interpretation. All tools that have been implemented for the sake of this study, data sets through the various steps as well as resulting visualizations have been published on-line and are free to use. The tutorial is not meant to be a comprehensive overview and detailed description of all possible ways of analyzing data from the social web, but using the steps outlined herein one can certainly reproduce the results of the study or use the same or similar methodology for other datasets. Results of the study show that a special kind of conceptual network generated by natural language processing of articles on the blogging site, namely a conceptual network constructed by the rule that two concepts (keywords) are connected if they were extracted from the same article, seem to be the best predictor of the current political discourse in Croatia when compared to the other constructed conceptual networks.

  abstract = {Computing is increasingly ubiquitous, with everyday items including smartphones, cars, clothes and household appliances gaining increasingly sophisticated computing and communication capacities. With the development of the Internet of Things, it is just a matter of time before devices have to collaborate and compete with each other, in order to provide better services to mankind. These embedded software systems are increasingly autonomous and connected, and can thus be modeled as multiagent systems (MAS). Only 30 years ago it was science fiction that over a billion people will exchange billions of e-mails on a daily basis. Today a scenario of millions of collaborating agents sometimes embedded in gadgets and appliances, sometimes in form of networked and big data services, may also sound futuristic. However given the current rate of development in electronics, we will soon have to manage large scale MAS where millions of agents exist, collaborate and compete. Organization theory provides the necessary methodology to approach complex systems in order to design, implement and strategically manage them towards success. In this paper a state-of-the-art on organizational design techniques for large-scale MAS will be presented, missing advancements will be identified and a roadmap for future developments and application scenarios will be provided.},

The platform consists of an elaborate on-line role-playing game, a survey tool as well as a data analytics application. The platform has been pilot tested in 20 primary schools (students from grade 1 - 4) in Croatia as part of the e-Schools (cro. e-\v Skole) project with an additional meta-survey to gather student satisfaction and additional feedback. Initial results show that most students were satisfied with the implemented platform and it's ease of use.},

With the growing popularity of knowledge-based systems, there arose also a need for a systematic approach for building such systems, similar to methodologies in mainstream software engineering. Over the years, the discipline of knowledge engineering has evolved into the development of theory, methods, and tools for developing knowledge-intensive applications. In other words, it provides guidance about when and how to apply particular knowledge-presentation techniques for solving particular problems. This chapter discusses a number of principles that have become the baseline of modern knowledge engineering. These include the common distinction made in knowledge engineering between task knowledge and domain knowledge. It explores the notion of problem-solving tasks in detail and presents typical patterns and methods for solving such tasks. It focuses on the domain perspective, in particular the representation and use of ontologies and discusses the main techniques that are being used in knowledge engineering.},

  abstract = {The biodiversity domain, and in particular biological taxonomy, is moving in the direction of semantization of its research outputs. The present work introduces OpenBiodiv-O, the ontology that serves as the basis of the OpenBiodiv Knowledge Management System. Our intent is to provide an ontology that fills the gaps between ontologies for biodiversity resources, such as DarwinCore-based ontologies, and semantic publishing ontologies, such as the SPAR Ontologies. We bridge this gap by providing an ontology focusing on biological taxonomy. OpenBiodiv-O introduces classes, properties, and axioms in the domains of scholarly biodiversity publishing and biological taxonomy and aligns them with several important domain ontologies (FaBiO, DoCO, DwC, Darwin-SW, NOMEN, ENVO). By doing so, it bridges the ontological gap across scholarly biodiversity publishing and biological taxonomy and allows for the creation of a Linked Open Dataset (LOD) of biodiversity information (a biodiversity knowledge graph) and enables the creation of the OpenBiodiv Knowledge Management System. A key feature of the ontology is that it is an ontology of the scientific process of biological taxonomy and not of any particular state of knowledge. This feature allows it to express a multiplicity of scientific opinions. The resulting OpenBiodiv knowledge system may gain a high level of trust in the scientific community as it does not force a scientific opinion on its users (e.g. practicing taxonomists, library researchers, etc.), but rather provides the tools for experts to encode different views as science progresses. OpenBiodiv-O provides a conceptual model of the structure of a biodiversity publication and the development of related taxonomic concepts. It also serves as the basis for the OpenBiodiv Knowledge Management System.},

  abstract = {The promise of artificial intelligence thus far is greater than its actual application in healthcare, though it has been developed to be used effectively in this field. One application of technology in this setting is chatbot use for mental health support. Chatbots are conversational entities that mimic human conversations to interact with a human user as if two human agents are engaging with one another.  Chatbots have the potential to engage those who might otherwise be unable or unwilling to receive mental health care by circumventing many of the barriers that prevent people from receiving care from a human provider. In the mental health arena, both practical barriers (such as geographic location and financial costs) as well as societal barriers (such as self and societal stigma) prevent people from accessing treatment. Even some of those who are able to overcome some most commonly cited barriers to care cannot receive it due to the lack of providers as compared to demand for aid. Thus, there is a need for a massive enhancement of mental health services that is not currently being met, where chatbots could rise to meet these needs.  Despite lengthy discussion of the negative possibilities that I will summarize in this paper, the positive outcomes remain especially promising. This technology as a therapy, however, is investigational, as it has not yet been approved for use. Because of this, I advocate for moving forward with this technology, but cautiously. In this paper I will identify different areas of ethical concern regarding chatbot use for mental health support. I will explain why the identification of harms matter, and what steps, if any, can be taken to prevent and mitigate them. Most importantly, I will reiterate that though this technology is investigational thus far, it has the potential to be a widely successful therapeutic solution to many barriers of access, and that these considerations are paramount for the ethical development of this technology in the mental health space.},

  abstract = {The key idea behind active learning is that a machine learning algorithm can perform better with less training if it is allowed to choose the data from which it learns. An active learner may pose "queries," usually in the form of unlabeled data instances to be labeled by an "oracle" (e.g., a human annotator) that already understands the nature of the problem. This sort of approach is well-motivated in many modern machine learning and data mining applications, where unlabeled data may be abundant or easy to come by, but training labels are difficult, time-consuming, or expensive to obtain. This book is a general introduction to active learning. It outlines several scenarios in which queries might be formulated, and details many query selection algorithms which have been organized into four broad categories, or "query selection frameworks." We also touch on some of the theoretical foundations of active learning, and conclude with an overview of the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches in practice, including a summary of ongoing work to address these open challenges and opportunities.},

  abstract = {In the last decade advances of computer technologies have lead towards a technological reality where the line between information consumers and information producers is blurred. This technological omnipresence allows for unprecedented data creation capabilities. Based on various data sources, it seems humans have fully embraced data-generating activities. One such activity is using online social network applications, like Facebook or Twitter in almost all aspects of their lives. One of the main features of online social network applications is perceived freedom of speech, individuality and privacy, even though every application has some special features. Therefore, content generated using these services presents the public with interesting insights in private life of people and their attitudes towards public affairs. Social network applications are active the most during specific public events aimed at the massive public. Due to its brevity, ease of use and frequency, Twitter is an interesting social network application for research and analysis. Other than allowing almost exclusively short messages (up to 140 characters), a tweet (a Twitter post) can contain location of the message sender as well as a graphic to accompany the textual message. The textual part of the message may contain so called hashtags -- keywords used for indexing and easy identification of a subject the message is related to. These hashtags allow us to group messages related to a specific event. Recent governmental elections held in Croatia were very popular amongst the Croatian Twitter community. Usage of hashtags allowed us to identify the right messages and thus most-used words to describe this event and potentially identify how people felt when talking, i.e. writing, about politics and the held elections. Furthermore, geolocation information, optionally embedded in a tweet, makes it possible to analyze which keywords were used in which parts of Croatia, all pertaining to the held governmental elections. Public opinion is only a few tweets away, but are the results similar to the election results? If tweet-based opinion can be constructed, does it differ from the real results? These and similar questions will be addressed in this paper.},

  abstract = {Educational practices based on individual differences have become more significant as a result of technological advances. Learners today, demand learning processes which contain visual stimuli, ease of use, fast thinking and movement and playful activities. The two of such learning approaches are gamification and game-based learning. This research is a concept-centric meta-synthesis study examining player types as an individual difference in playful learning environments. In this research, the studies which analysed the typology of players, are examined in terms of methods used, game environments and contextual aspects Content analysis revealed the common points and 9 different thematic components in relation to general player typology were identified. According to study, it is concluded that, player typologies can be used as an individual difference criterion in the game-based educational processes. It is also recognized that player typologies identified by different researchers may not be eligible for all settings and practices. Given that game-based approaches are highly affected from cultural context, cultural characteristics of community of learners should be taken into consideration if these approaches to be employed in learning environments.},

However, not many of the existing computational approaches make use of a rich theoretical basis developed in social science. Therefore, often mathematically sound models are invalid in practice. This paper proposes a formal approach for modeling of characteristics and behavior of agents in organizations, diverse aspects of which are represented using an expressive formal framework. The approach is based on the theoretical findings from social science and enables analysis of how different organizational and environmental factors influence the behavior and performance of agents. The approach is illustrated by a simulation case study.},

  abstract = {In this paper an agent-based ambient agent architecture is presented based on monitoring human's interaction with his or her environment and performing cognitive analysis of the causes of observed or predicted behaviour. Within this agent architecture, a cognitive model for the human is taken as a point of departure. From the cognitive model it is automatically derived how internal cognitive states affect human's performance aspects. Furthermore, for these cognitive states representation relations are derived from the cognitive model, expressed by temporal specifications involving events that will be monitored. The representation relations are verified on the monitoring information automatically, resulting in the identification of cognitive states, which affect the performance aspects. In such a way the ambient agent model is able to provide a more in depth cognitive analysis of causes of (un)satisfactory performance and based on this analysis to generate interventions in a knowledgeable manner. The application of the architecture proposed is demonstrated by two examples from the ambient-assisted living domain and the computer-assisted instruction domain.},

  abstract = {Task execution in multi-agent environments may require cooperation among agents. Given a set of agents and a set of tasks which they have to satisfy, we consider situations where each task should be attached to a group of agents that will perform the task. Task allocation to groups of agents is necessary when tasks cannot be performed by a single agent. However it may also be beneficial when groups perform more efficiently with respect to the single agents' performance. In this paper we present several solutions to the problem of task allocation among autonomous agents, and suggest that the agents form coalitions in order to perform tasks or improve the efficiency of their performance. We present efficient distributed algorithms with low ratio bounds and with low computational complexities. These properties are proven theoretically and supported by simulations and an implementation in an agent system. Our methods are based on both the algorithmic aspects of combinatorics and approximation algorithms for NP-hard problems. We first present an approach to agent coalition formation where each agent must be a member of only one coalition. Next, we present the domain of overlapping coalitions. We proceed with a discussion of the domain where tasks may have a precedence order. Finally, we discuss the case of implementation in an open, dynamic agent system. For each case we provide an algorithm that will lead agents to the formation of coalitions, where each coalition is assigned a task. Our algorithms are any-time algorithms, they are simple, efficient and easy to implement.},

  abstract = {Using AI approaches to automatically design mechanisms has been a central research mission at the interface of AI and economics [Conitzer and Sandholm, 2002]. Previous approaches that attempt to design revenue optimal auctions for the multi-dimensional settings fall short in at least one of the three aspects: 1) representation -- search in a space that probably does not even contain the optimal mechanism; 2) exactness -- finding a mechanism that is either not truthful or far from optimal; 3) domain dependence -- need a different design for different environment settings. To resolve the three difficulties, in this paper, we put forward -- MenuNet -- a unified neural network based framework that automatically learns to design revenue optimal mechanisms. Our framework consists of a mechanism network that takes an input distribution for training and outputs a mechanism, as well as a buyer network that takes a mechanism as input and output an action. Such a separation in design mitigates the difficulty to impose incentive compatibility constraints on the mechanism, by making it a rational choice of the buyer. As a result, our framework easily overcomes the previously mentioned difficulty in incorporating IC constraints and always returns exactly incentive compatible mechanisms. We then apply our framework to a number of multi-item revenue optimal design settings, for a few of which the theoretically optimal mechanisms are unknown. We then go on to theoretically prove that the mechanisms found by our framework are indeed optimal. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to apply neural networks to discover optimal auction mechanisms with provable optimality.},

The challenging tasks, reward incentives, systematic levels, and the ranking of users according to their achievements are just some of the elements that demonstrate strong gamification elements within this popular language learning application. This application's pervasive reach, flexible functionality, and freemium business model has brought significant attention to gamification in MALL. The present systematic review aims to summarize different methods, frameworks, settings, and research samples used to assess Duolingo's design and impact on various learning outcomes. We carried out a complete database search for articles focused on the issues of design, application, and pedagogies in the use of Duolingo. Three hundred and sixty-seven records were initially found, and 35 of those were selected for final inclusion based on language choice, theoretical frameworks, design, sampling, data collection, and analyses (see Appendix 1 for full list). The results indicated that the majority of research from 2012-2020 was design-focused, quantitative in nature, and used non-probability sampling methods. The focus on app design marks an emphasis on the creation of tools rather than the process and outcomes of language learning from using these tools. Additional results revealed preferences for performance-based research questions, for English as language of choice in research, and for the USA as the most prominent context for Duolingo research studies. Furthermore, our review highlights research gaps specific to Duolingo, yet generalizable to other MALL applications. The results are useful to researchers seeking to assess, evaluate, and understand MALL, gamification, and Duolingo as well as to practitioners interested in utilizing MALL in formal and informal learning environments.},

  abstract = {Purpose This exploratory paper investigates gamification as a medium for knowledge workers to interact with each other. The purpose of this paper is to open the discussion around the sustaining impact that gamification might have on knowledge management (KM). Design/methodology/approach The paper employs an exploratory literature review investigating the current state of the art in relation to KM and gamification; this literature review serves as the starting point of subsequent theorizing. Findings Based on the literature review the authors theorize that the use of gamification in KM can go far beyond the motivational aspects. To name just a few uses of gamification, it can help in: supporting flexibility, facilitating transparency and therefore improving trust, visualizing skills and competences as well as generating requirements for new competences and promoting a collaborative environment among the knowledge workers. Research limitations/implications This paper opens the discussion around KM and gamification and suggests a wide range of areas for further research. Practical implications In this paper the authors argue that by looking at gamification as more than just a set of tools for improving motivation and engagement a company can address some pitfalls of a particular type of knowledge workers. Originality/value Gamification is a new, but increasingly popular approach, which has been shown to be powerful in many areas. This paper is novel in that it initiates a dialogue around the impact that gamification might have on KM.},

  abstract = {Develop and use bots in video gaming to automate game processes and see possible ways to avoid this kind of automation. This book explains how bots can be very helpful in games such as multiplayer online games, both for training your character and for automating repetitious game processes in order to start a competition with human opponents much faster. Some players might use bots for cheating or avoiding game rules to gain an advantage over opponents - a sophisticated form of hacking that includes some elements of artificial intelligence (AI). However, while Practical Video Game Bots considers these topics, it is not a cheater's guide. Rather, this book is an attempt to overcome the information vacuum regarding bot development in video game applications. Through the use of three case study game examples, it covers most methods and technologies that are used by bot developers, and the details of anti-cheating systems. This book provides answers and useful advice for topics such as process automation, reverse engineering, and network applications. Modern bot applications use technologies from all these domains. You will also consider the work mechanisms of different kinds of bots and will write simple prototypes. What You Will Learn Discover bots and apply them to game applications Use clicker bots with OS-level embedding data, output-device capture, and more Develop in-game bots, with process memory analysis and access Work with out-game bots, with network interception and embedding data Deal with input device emulation and OS-level interception data Who This Book Is For Those with some prior experience in game development and coding experience in Python, C++, and Windows APIs.},

  abstract = {In the past decade, social media has become increasingly popular for news consumption due to its easy access, fast dissemination, and low cost. However, social media also enables the wide propagation of "fake news," i.e., news with intentionally false information. Fake news on social media can have significant negative societal effects. Therefore, fake news detection on social media has recently become an emerging research area that is attracting tremendous attention. This book, from a data mining perspective, introduces the basic concepts and characteristics of fake news across disciplines, reviews representative fake news detection methods in a principled way, and illustrates challenging issues of fake news detection on social media. In particular, we discussed the value of news content and social context, and important extensions to handle early detection, weakly-supervised detection, and explainable detection. The concepts, algorithms, and methods described in this lecture can help harness the power of social media to build effective and intelligent fake news detection systems. This book is an accessible introduction to the study of detecting fake news on social media. It is an essential reading for students, researchers, and practitioners to understand, manage, and excel in this area.},

Such a screening process is expected to appear in future smart healthcare systems. This device functions as a smart mirror which displays daily information such as the weather, events, headline news, currency rates, stocks, and reminders. Elderly users can view information on their mental health while dressing themselves in front of the mirror. The information on their daily emotions will be collected to monitor their health long-term as a nurse or caretaker in their house would do. Moreover, to observe the elderly users emotions, we incorporate additional systems such as a chat bot, facial recognition, voice/speech recognition, and posture recognition. The device also serves as a communication tool that facilitates telemedicine, helping the elderly users at home feel more connected with their doctors. This helps doctors diagnose, follow up, and treat their patients long-term.},

  abstract = {Open multiagent systems are those in which the agents can enter or leave the system freely. In these systems any entity with unknown intention can occupy the environment. For this scenario trust and reputation mechanisms should be used to choose partners in order to request services or delegate tasks. Trust and reputation models have been proposed in the Multiagent Systems area as a way to assist agents to select good partners in order to improve interactions between them. Most of the trust and reputation models proposed in the literature take into account their functional aspects, but not how they affect the reasoning cycle of the agent. That is, under the perspective of the agent, a trust model is usually just a ``black box'' and the agents usually does not take into account their emotional state to make decisions as well as humans often do. As well as trust, agent's emotions also have been studied with the aim of making the actions and reactions of the agents more like those of humans being in order to imitate their reasoning and decision making mechanisms. In this paper we analyse some proposed models found in the literature and propose a BDI and multi-context based agent model which includes emotional reasoning to lead trust and reputation in open multiagent systems.},

Recently, AlphaGo became the first program to defeat a world champion in the game of Go. The tree search in AlphaGo evaluated positions and selected moves using deep neural networks. These neural networks were trained by supervised learning from human expert moves, and by reinforcement learning from self-play. Here we introduce an algorithm based solely on reinforcement learning, without human data, guidance or domain knowledge beyond game rules. AlphaGo becomes its own teacher: a neural network is trained to predict AlphaGo's own move selections and also the winner of AlphaGo's games. This neural network improves the strength of the tree search, resulting in higher quality move selection and stronger self-play in the next iteration. Starting tabula rasa, our new program AlphaGo Zero achieved superhuman performance, winning 100--0 against the previously published, champion-defeating AlphaGo.},

  abstract = {Theability to create effectivemulti-agent organizations is key to the development of larger, more diverse multi-agent systems. In this article we present KB-ORG: a fully automated, knowledge-based organization designer for multi-agent systems. Organization design is the process that accepts organizational goals, environmental expectations, perfor- mance requirements, role characterizations, and agent descriptions and assigns roles to each agent. These long-term roles serve as organizational-control guidelines that are used by each agent in making moment-to-moment operational control decisions. An important aspect of KB-ORG is its efficient, knowledge-informed search process for designing multi-agent orga- nizations. KB-ORG uses both application-level and coordination-level organization design knowledge to explore the combinatorial search space of candidate organizations selectively. KB-ORGalso delays making coordination-level organizational decisions until it has explored and elaborated candidate application-level agent roles. This approach significantly reduces the exploration effort required to produce effective designs as compared to modeling and evaluation-based approaches that do not incorporate design expertise. KB-ORG designs are not restricted to a single organization form such as a hierarchy, and the organization designs described here contain both hierarchical and peer-to-peer elements.We use examples from the distributed sensor network (DSN) domain to showhowKB-ORG uses situational param- eters as well as application-level and coordination-level knowledge to generate organization designs.We also show that KB-ORG designs effective, yet substantially different, organiza- tions when given different organizational requirements and environmental expectations.},

  abstract = {Agent-based models (ABMs) are increasingly being used for exploring and supporting decision making about social science scenarios involving modelling of human agents. However existing agent-based simulation platforms (e.g., SWARM, Repast) provide limited support for the simulation of more complex cognitive agents required by such scenarios. We present a framework that allows Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) cognitive agents to be embedded in an ABM system. Architecturally, this means that the ``brains'' of an agent can be modelled in the BDI system in the usual way, while the ``body'' exists in the ABM system. The architecture is flexible in that the ABM can still have non-BDI agents in the simulation, and the BDI-side can have agents that do not have a physical counterpart (such as an organisation). The framework addresses a key integration challenge of coupling event-based BDI systems, with time-stepped ABM systems. Our framework is modular and supports integration of off-the-shelf BDI systems with off-the-shelf ABM systems. The framework is Open Source, and all integrations and applications are available for use by the modelling community.},

  abstract = {Background: The shift in the last decades to screen-based and increasingly web-based gaming activity has raised concerns about its impact on the development of children and adolescents. Despite decades of research into gaming and related psychosocial effects, the question remains how best to identify what degree or context of gaming may be a cause for concern. Objective: This study aimed to classify adolescents into gamer profiles based on both gaming behaviors and well-being. Once we distinguished the different gamer profiles, we aimed to explore whether membership to a specific profile could be predicted based on a range of personal characteristics and experiences that could then help identify those at risk. Methods: We explored gaming and well-being in an adolescent school population (aged 12-18 years) in England as part of the 2021 OxWell student survey. Self-report measures of time spent playing games on computers or consoles, time spent playing games on mobile phones, the Game Addiction Scale, and the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale were used to classify adolescent heavy gamers (playing games for at least 3.5 hours a day) using latent profile analysis. We used multinomial logistic regression analysis to predict the profile membership based on a range of personal characteristics and experiences. Results: In total, 12,725 participants answered the OxWell gaming questions. Almost one-third (3970/12,725, 31.2\%) indicated that they play games for at least 3.5 hours a day. The correlation between time spent playing video games overall and well-being was not significant (P=.41). The latent profile analysis distinguished 6 profiles of adolescent heavy gamers: adaptive computer gamers (1747/3970, 44\%); casual computer gamers (873/3970, 22\%); casual phone gamers (595/3970, 15\%); unknown device gamers (476/3970, 12\%); maladaptive computer gamers (238/3970, 6\%); and maladaptive phone gamers (79/3970, 2\%). In comparison with adaptive computer gamers, maladaptive phone gamers were mostly female (odds ratio [OR] 0.08, 95\% CI 0.03-0.21) and were more likely to have experienced abuse or neglect (OR 3.18, 95\% CI 1.34-7.55). Maladaptive computer gamers, who reported gaming both on their mobile phones and on the computer, were mostly male and more likely to report anxiety (OR 2.25, 95\% CI 1.23-4.12), aggressive behavior (OR 2.83, 95\% CI 1.65-4.88), and web-based gambling (OR 2.18, 95\% CI 1.24-3.81). Conclusions: A substantial number of adolescents are spending {$\geq$}3.5 hours gaming each day, with almost 1 in 10 (317/3970, 8\%) reporting co-occurring gaming and well-being issues. Long hours gaming using mobile phones, particularly common in female gamers, may signal poorer functioning and indicate a need for additional support. Although increased time gaming might be changing how adolescents spend their free time and might thus have public health implications, it does not seem to relate to co-occurring well-being issues or mental ill-health for the majority of adolescent gamers.},

Within this model, we investigate the problem of computing coalition structures that maximize social welfare, and the problem of computing core-stable coalition structures. In addition to giving some general results on these problems, we identify tractable instances of the problems, and present algorithms for these cases.},

  abstract = {The current coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is again reminding us of the importance of using telehealth to deliver care, especially as means of reducing the risk of cross-contamination caused by close contact. For telehealth to be effective as part of an emergency response it first needs to become a routinely used part of our health system. Hence, it is time to step back and ask why telehealth is not mainstreamed. In this article, we highlight key requirements for this to occur. Strategies to ensure that telehealth is used regularly in acute, post-acute and emergency situations, alongside conventional service delivery methods, include flexible funding arrangements, training and accrediting our health workforce. Telehealth uptake also requires a significant change in management effort and the redesign of existing models of care. Implementing telehealth proactively rather than reactively is more likely to generate greater benefits in the long-term, and help with the everyday (and emergency) challenges in healthcare.},

  abstract = {When two parties need to split some reward between them, negotiation theory can predict what offers the parties will make and how the reward will be split. When a single party needs to evaluate several alternatives and choose the best among them, optimal-stopping-rule theories guide it as to how to perform the exploration, what to explore next and when to stop. We consider a model in which party A needs to choose one alternative, but has no information and no means of acquiring information on the value of each alternative. Party B, on the other hand, has no interest in what party A chooses, but can perform (costly) exploration to learn about the different alternatives. As both negotiation and exploration take time, the common deadline and discounting factor further tie the processes together. We study the combined model, providing a comprehensive game theoretic based analysis, enabling the extraction of the payments that need to be made between agents A and B, and the social welfare. Special emphasis is placed on studying the effect of interleaving negotiation and exploration, and when is this method preferred over separating the two. In addition to exploring the basic questions, we also consider the case in which one of the parties has some control over the parameters of the problem (e.g. the negotiation protocol), and show how it increases the utility of this party but decreases the overall welfare.},

The model was identified through a pilot study involving nine expert players. The model fitness was then verified in a main experiment involving eighteen regular players. Our results showed that the utilization (4 players) and emergence (4 players) models were most frequently used, followed by the balance-usefulness (3 players), usefulness (3 players), and usefulness-balance (2 players) models. The coding scheme for this research was built from video observations and a literature review. We suggest this model is applicable for the implementation of a human-like virtual character's artificial intelligence algorithm in the game editors and the server loader for quality assurance.},

By covering a broad range of aspects that are related to ontologies, i.e. language and engineering aspects, infrastructures and applications, the reader of this handbook may either get a broad, comprehensive picture of the field of ontologies or he may investigate specific aspects of ontologies that are most relevant for her or his work.},

While they have existed since the 1960's, they have recently been used to provide a form of therapy through software applications ("apps"). However, unlike licensed professionals who provide traditional mental health services, chatbots are not subject to confidentiality obligations. Currently, federal and state regulations that impose confidentiality obligations in the healthcare context do not apply to chatbots, and the regulations that do apply to chatbots do not impose such obligations. Because users engaging with these apps disclose information similar to information disclosed during a therapy session, this Article proposes a new regulatoy framework, through new legislation, to limit the use and disclosure of information received by software- based therapy technologies.},

Many educators have attempted, with varying degrees of success, to effectively utilize game dynamics to increase student motivation and achievement in the classroom. In an effort to better understand how gamification can effectively be utilized to this end, presented here is a review of existing literature on the subject as well as a case study on three different applications of gamification in the post-secondary setting. This analysis reveals that the underlying dynamics that make games engaging are largely already recognized and utilized in modern pedagogical practices, although under different designations. This provides some legitimacy to a practice that is sometimes dismissed as superficial, and also provides a way of formulating useful guidelines for those wishing to utilize the power of games to motivate student achievement.},

  abstract = {Realistic humanoid robots (RHRs) with embodied artificial intelligence (EAI) have numerous applications in society as the human face is the most natural interface for communication and the human body the most effective form for traversing the manmade areas of the planet. Thus, developing RHRs with high degrees of human-likeness provides a life-like vessel for humans to physically and naturally interact with technology in a manner insurmountable to any other form of non-biological human emulation. This study outlines a human\&ndash;robot interaction (HRI) experiment employing two automated RHRs with a contrasting appearance and personality. The selective sample group employed in this study is composed of 20 individuals, categorised by age and gender for a diverse statistical analysis. Galvanic skin response, facial expression analysis, and AI analytics permitted cross-analysis of biometric and AI data with participant testimonies to reify the results. This study concludes that younger test subjects preferred HRI with a younger-looking RHR and the more senior age group with an older looking RHR. Moreover, the female test group preferred HRI with an RHR with a younger appearance and male subjects with an older looking RHR. This research is useful for modelling the appearance and personality of RHRs with EAI for specific jobs such as care for the elderly and social companions for the young, isolated, and vulnerable.},

Steven Strogatz, a leading mathematician in the fields of chaos and complexity theory, explains how enormous systems can synchronize themselves, from the electrons in a superconductor to the pacemaker cells in our hearts. He shows that although these phenomena might seem unrelated on the surface, at a deeper level there is a connection, forged by the unifying power of mathematics.},

  abstract = {In this paper we propose a model that supports the emergence of conventions via multi-agent learning in social networks. In our model, individual agents repeatedly interact with their neighbours in a game called Ali Baba and the Thief. An agent learns its strategy to play the game using the learning rule imitate-the-best. We show that some conventions prescribing peaceful behaviours can emerge a er repeated interactions among agents inhabited in some social networks. Our experiments suggest that there are critical points of convention emergence in Ali Baba and the Thief. When the quotient of the amount of robbery and the initial utility is smaller than the critical point, the probability of convention emergence is high. The probability drops dramatically as long as the quotient is larger than the critical point.},

Methods               : The types of character  are called the experts, assistants, family members and pets according to two evaluation scales which are 'friendly--unfriendly' and 'dominant--submissive.' Professional Mandarin Chinese broadcasters were invited to record their voice of a neutral sentence respectively. With differences  in pitch, volume, tone color and sound quality, varied types of characters were simulated and eight pieces of voice record were generated. Twenty old people were selected to participate in the measurement test to grade these eight pieces of voice based on their acceptability of these voices.               Results               : Experiment shows that the male test group's preference value to the male voice is 4.4250, a little higher than their preference value to the female voice which is 3.9000. But the Independent Samples T Test shows that the significance of F Test is 0.345 {$>$} 0.05, while that  of corresponding T test is 0.051, a little higher than 0.05. Hence it can be assumed that the male test group has almost no difference in the preference for voice gender. And the average of the female test group's preference value is 3.9500 for the male voice and 4.9750 for the female voice.  Therefore, the female test group prefer female voice. In Independent Samples T Test, the significance of F Test is 0.909 {$>$} 0.05, while that of T Test is 0.000 {$<$} 0.05. Hence the female test group's voice gender preference has statistically significance difference. In terms of the individualization  of voice type with different voice characters, the average grades from male test group to expert, assistant, family and pet type is 4.75, 4.85, 3.9, 3.15, while male test group is 3.65, 4.40, 5.40, 4.41.               Conclusion               : Based on the experimental results and verification, voice interaction  among the elderly patients in the home environment, family-female type is the best choice.},

It discusses what it means to be 'good' or 'bad' at this predominantly two-player game, and how this impacts on the shared experience of spectacle, since, as Guy Debord suggests, 'The spectacle is not a collection of images; it is a social relation between people that is mediated by images'. By figuring the performing gamer into a critique of spectacle, the chapter foregrounds the spectacular potential of play. The chapter explores the relationship between the spectacular aesthetic and a sense of gratification associated with skilled gameplay, called the 'reward-spectacle'. The reward-spectacle is a textual motif of games design and play.},

In this paper, we describe a practical solution to this problem by the implementation of client-side gamification rule processing so that most events generated by players can be processed without the need to involve server-side functions; therefore, only a handful of data have to be transmitted to the server for global state synchronization, and only when an Internet connection is available. For this purpose, we adopt a simple textual gamification rule definition format, implement the rule parser and event processor, and evaluate the solution in terms of performance in experimental conditions. The obtained results are optimistic, showing that the developed solution can easily handle rule sets and event streams of realistic sizes. The solution is planned to be integrated into the next version of the FGPE gamified programming education platform.},

  abstract = {Quantification of human group-behavior has so far defied an empirical, falsifiable approach. This is due to tremendous difficulties in data acquisition of social systems. Massive multiplayer online games (MMOG) provide a fascinating new way of observing hundreds of thousands of simultaneously socially interacting individuals engaged in virtual economic activities. We have compiled a data set consisting of practically all actions of all players over a period of 3 years from a MMOG played by 300,000 people. This large-scale data set of a socio-economic unit contains all social and economic data from a single and coherent source. Players have to generate a virtual income through economic activities to 'survive' and are typically engaged in a multitude of social activities offered within the game. Our analysis of high-frequency log files focuses on three types of social networks, and tests a series of social-dynamics hypotheses. In particular we study the structure and dynamics of friend-, enemy- and communication networks. We find striking differences in topological structure between positive (friend) and negative (enemy) tie networks. All networks confirm the recently observed phenomenon of network densification. We propose two approximate social laws in communication networks, the first expressing betweenness centrality as the inverse square of the overlap, the second relating communication strength to the cube of the overlap. These empirical laws provide strong quantitative evidence for the Weak ties hypothesis of Granovetter. Further, the analysis of triad significance profiles validates well-established assertions from social balance theory. We find overrepresentation (underrepresentation) of complete (incomplete) triads in networks of positive ties, and vice versa for networks of negative ties. Empirical transition probabilities between triad classes provide evidence for triadic closure with extraordinarily high precision. For the first time we provide empirical results for large-scale networks of negative social ties. Whenever possible we compare our findings with data from non-virtual human groups and provide further evidence that online game communities serve as a valid model for a wide class of human societies. With this setup we demonstrate the feasibility for establishing a 'socio-economic laboratory' which allows to operate at levels of precision approaching those of the natural sciences.All data used in this study is fully anonymized; the authors have the written consent to publish from the legal department of the Medical University of Vienna. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Based on our claim, we proposes a method of interpretation by implementation (IbI), which explores factors that drastically change simulation results through an investigation on the modeling process of computational models. A careful investigation on the capabilities of the IbI approach, which comprises the three methods of (a) breakdown and representation, (b) assumption or premise modification, and (c) layer change investigation, derives the following conclusions: (1) the IbI approach has the potential of finding underlying factors that determine the characteristics of an organization; (2) the IbI approach can specify points of attention at necessary levels when analyzing an organization; and (3) the IbI approach has such advantages as wide applicability, the effective use of employed models, and KISS principle support.},

The Semantic Web provides a common framework that allows data to be shared and reused across applications, enterprises, and community boundaries. However, lack of annotated semantic data is a bottleneck to make the Semantic Web vision a reality. Therefore, it is indeed necessary to automate the process of semantic annotation. In the past few years, there was a rapid expansion of activities in the semantic annotation area. Many methods have been proposed for automating the annotation process. However, due to the heterogeneity and the lack of structure of the Web data, automated discovery of the targeted or unexpected knowledge information still present many challenging research problems. In this chapter, we study the problems of semantic annotation and introduce the state-of-the-art methods for dealing with the problems. We will also give a brief survey of the developed systems based on the methods. Several real-world applications of semantic annotation will be introduced as well. Finally, some emerging challenges in semantic annotation will be discussed.},

  abstract = {Here it is argued that with game-based learning it is possible, through the inherit teaching mechanics in video games, to sustain stimulation throughout a class within Higher Education (HE). That is, the ``net generation'' (Tapscott 1999, p.6) is intrinsically motivated by games and that commercial video games potentially have an important role in the classroom to assist learning of a range of important transferable skills. We further argue that commercial off the shelf (COTS) game design is replete with effective constructivist teaching structures and that such games should play a more prominent role within mainstream education. As suggested by their title COTS are games that one can purchase on the high street and as such are often overlooked by scholars studying the pedagogic efficacy of bespoke educational gaming environments or serious games. For the student there is value in `edutainment' as an effective learning process that blurs the line between work and play, maintaining initial levels of concentration through equilibrium of entertainment and education (Ryan et al., 2006). Through an examination of the learning mechanisms found in cognitively motivational and commercially successful video games this commentary will explore ``synergy between pedagogy and engagement'' (Van Eck 2006, p.18) and what such games can offer to the field of education. This commentary will not focus on bespoke software that has enjoyed considerable research attention so far. In doing so it is hoped to open the debate on the utility that COTS have within the classroom.It is easy to dismiss such video games as commercially driven distractions, but in fact COTS have been linked to increased motivation, more varied learning methodologies and performance at least equal to that achieved by traditional means, but with greater enjoyment of the learning process itself (Ryan et al., 2006; Ebner and Hoizinger 2006). They achieve this by means of teaching strategies that provide cognitive stimulation, motivation, constant assessment and the encouragement of a system style of thinking (Gee 2007). In addition to this features unique to COTS such as in-game tutorials, challenging levels and eventual boss characters, exist to incentivize the player into a learning process analogous to the educational phases of learning, practice and assessment, teaching them via what is essentially ``the scientific method'' (Wright 2009). 1. Cognitively stimulatingPlaying Electronic Art's `Medal of Honour' or Activision's `Call of Duty' does result in improvements in visual acuity (Green and Bavelier 2006; Achtman, Green and Bavelier 2008). Further work shows that such games also stimulate at the cognitive level. Take for example the ``Tetris effect'', a form of hypnagogic imagery resulting from playing Alexey Pazhitnov's Tetris that affects the player first during play and continuing to do so in its wake. The elemental shapes (or ``Tetriminos'') found in Tetris stimulate our visual system to engage in low-level pattern recognition. Players report not only seeing falling Tetris shapes in their peripheral vision and while dreaming (Stickgold et al., 2000), but even find themselves attempting to mentally interlock real world objects together (Earling 1996), the core skill involved in playing the game. Indeed the same study (Stickgold et al., 2000) found that even amnesic participants with extensive bilateral medial temporal lobe damage produced similar reports, despite being unable to recall having played the game. It has also been shown that playing goal directed serious games such as Activision's `Call of Duty' ensures a release of dopamine in a region of the brain known as the ventral striatum (Koepp et al., 1998) which is an important part of the cortical networks thought to be implicated in the perception of reward (Lega et al., 2011). 2. MotivatingVideo games constantly incentivise the player with the prospect of being gratified for problem solving (Griffiths 2002) which has parallels with a well-run small group tutorial where praise or high marks are rewards for problem solving. Whether it be victory over the game's battles, solving a puzzle or the prospect of a better looking character to control, the player is constantly motivated with goal orientation via a ``carefully calibrated balance of rewards, challenges and chance'' (Chatfield 2010, p. 2). Players dislike interruption primarily because it interferes with their learning and odds of success; entertainment is a factor, but it is secondary to successful skill and knowledge development. Ironically then having paid to be entertained the player, quite happily, spends most of their time learning skills to overcome assessment, working toward optional personal goals and compulsory ones set by the game designer.It goes without saying that persistent motivation and goal-orientation are characteristics sought after by most students, the latter of which is no better demonstrated than with the example of Ultima Online. In this massively-multiplayer online game (MMO) hundreds of thousands of players play together online in real time, both cooperatively and competitively to develop their virtual characters. Players work on their skills and acquirein-game wealth either through trade, force or in some cases, much like in real life, a mix of both. Johnson cites the example of Troy Stolle, a construction site worker from Indianapolis who, having spent all day at his ``bone-jarringly repetitive work with hammer and nails'' (2006, p.27), would come home to Ultima Online and repeat essentially the same process in a virtual world. Stolle's character, nicknamed `Nils Hansen', was a grandmaster blacksmith, a title that took him six months of smithing to achieve. Smithing in Ultima Online involves clicking one's mouse cursor on virtual hillsides to mine ore, traveling a few minutes to the forge to click virtual ore into ingots and yet more clicking to turn said ingots into weapons and armor. Making the process even more time-consuming, each time any of these processes, which can fail outright, take place the output can produce high or low quality material, the latter of which is often worthless and thus scrapped. Playing these games is like ``having a part-time job---only instead of getting paid, it costs you money'' (Johnson 2006, p.27). Stolle was replacing his physical hammer and nail with virtual hammer and anvil, and paying \$9.95 a month to do so; he was also, albeit perhaps unwittingly, gaining transferable employability skills in the process, such as product management and an acute sensitivity to both the in-game economy and his customer base (Senior and Cubbidge 2010) . 3. Constantly and providing feedback COTS are all about ``delayed gratification'' (Johnson 2006, p.28) which is granted only when the player's skill and consistency has been assessed and deemed sufficient to proceed to the next, inevitably harder stage of assessment. Capcom's `Devil May Cry' is a case in point, employing a letter grading system that evaluates player performance dynamically, providing feedback by modeling the results of the player's decisions. Rather than evaluating player performance only at the end of a fiscal period, nearly a quarter of the display is at all times dedicated to a dynamic grading system which ranks the player's understanding of the game mechanics based on their performance. Should the player execute a varied and effective gameplay strategy that demonstrates an understanding of all they have been taught, their rank will rise through D, C, B and A to S, the equivalent of an A+. Should the player's successful execution of their strategy be countered and their educative state of ``flow'' (Cs\&\#237;kszentmih\&\#225;lyi 1992, p.8) interrupted this rank is reset back to D. This assessment is compiled at the end of each level in the form of a report, providing the player with an overview of their performance, individually ranking elements of gameplay such as speed and efficiency, as well as assigning an overall grade. This kind of dynamic feedback sits in contrast to that of traditional education, which tends to follow modular based structure and is delivered ``in big, ugly, rather unpleasant lumps'' (Chatfield 2010, p. 2) that presents a relatively limited picture of student progress. The relevance to education then is that, as teaching devices, serious games can constantly and automatically assess the learner's ability from the moment they start playing to the moment they stop; this is a promise that few other pedagogic tools can truly deliver on. 4. Ensuring failure is used as a learning deviceProbably the most common source of failure for students is failing to engage with a task in the first place. Video games bypass this personal barrier by adhering to the principle of ``low cost of failure and high reward for success'' (Gee 2007, p.59). Players choose to escape the game worlds, despite the fact that they constantly and bluntly assess their efforts, because they are incentivized through failure as much as through reward; ``the fastest way to winning is through losing, since each loss is a learning experience'' (Frand 2000, p.17). Take for example, Harmonix's `Rock Band', which like `Devil May Cry', is another game that constantly assesses skill. The game gauges players' success rate as a percentage which improves each time, becoming less and less of a failure. What keeps players interested is that failure occurs so often that it is effectively redefined as temporary, your efforts redeemable and improving with each attempt; failure is a reality, but it is one without consequences significant enough to deter your learning (Gee 2007).This redefinition of failure avoids a common pitfall of edutainment; sacrificing challenge in an attempt to keep the player entertained. Here, the learning process delivers on both fronts; it is at time challenging, it is never disenchanting for the learner. Success, however illusive, never seems out of reach because the relatively low cost of failure brings the two concepts much closer together, making them less polar and absolute. Even in the event of success player achievement is qualified, with a percentage often in the 80s or 90s. Due to the low cost of failure we are encouraged to strive for perfection, rather than being content with a minimum pass mark, reminding us that we have not won, but rather ``failed better'' (Chatfield 2010). 5. Encouraging systems thinking Wright's `SimCity' might not teach players what single-handedly running a bustling metropolis is like in real life, what it can teach is how different variables within a system interact in emergent and complex ways with each other (Chatfield 2010). As a result, the player learns to instinctively view the situation in front of them, be it real or virtual, as a whole and micromanage accordingly. They see each immediate task as part of a much larger system with numerous different, interacting variables at play, developing their own mental model in order to introduce order to something that is otherwise chaotic. This is significant because at present educational programmes are striving to offer the learner content that is dynamic and interactive (Corlett 1965). The capacity of video games to scale their cultural models to micro or macro levels and the dynamic nature of their content arguably makes them more indicative of and relevant to the world outside the classroom. This process is hugely incentivising in that it allows and encourages players to constantly gauge their progress, reminding them of where they've come from, what they're striving toward and how close they are to achieving it (See e.g., Stuart, 2011). Despite their challenging sophistication, themes and game mechanics and an audience with supposedly low attention spans COTS sell in the millions (Swing et al., 2010). Players of all ages are willing to ``reverse-engineer these complex models to understand what is under the hood of a game'' (Wright 2009). These games have the potential to demonstrate a ``synergy between pedagogy and engagement'' (Van Eck 2006, p.18). At the very least, the prospective benefits of game-based learning provide us with reason to examine our fear of diluting the aims of education by introducing elements of entertainment.},

  abstract = {We propose a new representation for coalitional games, called the coalitional skill vector model, where there is a set of skills in the system, and each agent has a skill vector--a vector consisting of values that reflect the agents' level in different skills. Furthermore, there is a set of goals, each with requirements expressed in terms of the minimum skill level necessary to achieve the goal. Agents can form coalitions to aggregate their skills, and achieve goals otherwise unachievable. We show that this representation is fully expressive, that is, it can represent any characteristic function game. We also show that, for some interesting classes of games, our representation is significantly more compact than the classical representation, and facilitates the development of efficient algorithms to solve the coalition structure generation problem, as well as the problem of computing the core and/or the least core. We also demonstrate that by using the coalitional skill vector representation, our solver can handle up to 500 agents.},

  abstract = {Background: COVID-19 has a profound impact on people with existing mental disorders, augmenting the prevailing inequalities in mental health. Methods: In order to understand the status of telepsychiatry in India and the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in mental health and its potential applications, a scoping review was done between March 2020 and May 2020. The literature review revealed 253 papers, which were used to derive the primary framework for analysis. The information was then reviewed for ideas and concepts, which were integrated with evidence from gray literature and categorized under broader themes based on the insights derived. Finally, a thematic framework was developed for discussion to tailor scientific information for decision-makers' needs. Results: Review findings are summarized under the following headings: changing patterns of health-seeking behavior, origin and evolution of telepsychiatry, possible applications of telepsychiatry and AI, technological features, and AI models in mental health. Conclusions: Though there are several potential opportunities, the time is not yet ripe for telepsychiatry and AI to be adopted fully in the field of mental health care. But it is time that we develop indigenous proprietary technology and test and validate it. With many solutions offered by telepsychiatry and AI, psychiatrists must choose an appropriate tool based on their requirements, availability of resources, and feasibility of deployment. Harmony between conventional care and technology-based care must be reached gradually.},

Procedural content generation research in Super Mario continues to prove popular to this day. However much of this work is based largely on the notions of creating `Mario-like' level designs, patterns or structures. In this paper, we argue for the need to diversify the generative systems used for level creation within the Super Mario domain through the introduction of more aesthetic-driven and `non-formalist' approaches towards game design. We assess the need for a broader approach to automated design of Mario artefacts and gameplay structures within the context of Super Mario Maker: a Super Mario Bros. level creation tool. By assessing a number of top-ranked levels established within the player community, we recognise a populist movement for more radical level design that the AI community should seek to embrace.},

While experimental works that draw on text generation and natural language processing have a rich history, this article focuses on commercial applications of AI narrative and looks to future applications of this technology. Video games have incorporated AI and procedural generation for many years, but more recently, new applications of this technology have emerged in other media. Director Oscar Sharp and artist Ross Goodwin, for example, generated significant media buzz about two short films that they produced which were written by their AI screenwriter. It's No Game (2017), in particular, offers an apt commentary on the possibility of replacing striking screenwriters with AI authors. Increasingly, AI agents and virtual assistants like Siri, Cortana, Alexa and Google Assistant are incorporated into our daily lives. As concerns about their eavesdropping circulate in news media, it is clear that these companions are learning a lot about us, which raises concerns about how our data might be employed in the future. This article explores current applications of AI for storytelling and future directions of this technology to offer insight into issues that have and will continue to arise as AI storytelling advances.},

The study reviewed recent research published in the past five years, which examined new technologies and potential future opportunities in anomaly detection. The literature review focused specifically on anomaly detection systems used in network traffic. This included various applications such as Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), Internet of Things (IoT), High Performance Computing, Industrial Control Systems (ICS), and Software Defined Networking (SDN) environments.

Using ELF, we implement a highly customizable real-time strategy (RTS) engine with three game environments (Mini-RTS, Capture the Flag and Tower Defense). Mini-RTS, as a miniature version of StarCraft, captures key game dynamics and runs at 40K frame-per-second (FPS) per core on a Macbook Pro notebook. When coupled with modern reinforcement learning methods, the system can train a full-game bot against built-in AIs end-to-end in one day with 6 CPUs and 1 GPU. In addition, our platform is flexible in terms of environment-agent communication topologies, choices of RL methods, changes in game parameters, and can host existing C/C++-based game environments like Arcade Learning Environment. Using ELF, we thoroughly explore training parameters and show that a network with Leaky ReLU and Batch Normalization coupled with long-horizon training and progressive curriculum beats the rule-based built-in AI more than 70\% of the time in the full game of Mini-RTS. Strong performance is also achieved on the other two games. In game replays, we show our agents learn interesting strategies.

  abstract = {Gamification has a great number of studies in the education area since the emergence of the term. However, there is a lack of primary and secondary studies that explore the negative effects that gamification may have on learners, and lack of studies that analyze the gamification design that are linked to those negative effects. Based on this premise, we aim at answering the following research question ``What are the negative effects that can occur in gamification when applied to educational contexts?''. We seek to answer this question by analyzing the negative effects that are associated to gamification and the gamified learning design that are linked with them. To answer this question, we conducted a systematic mapping study to identify these negative effects. Based on the studies that were analyzed, we identified and mapped 4 negative effects and their gameful design. Loss of Performance was the most occurring effect and Leaderboard the most cited game design element, among other 11 elements. Moreover, elements and effects were linked in order to identify how these elements may have influenced on these outcomes. Based on our results, we found out that the game design may lead to a negative impact. For instance, Leaderboards are strongly associated to many negative effects mapped in this work. This result is corroborated by the psychology literature regarding ranking systems within learning environments. We believe our work may be useful to guide gamification instructors and specialists to avoid those negative effects in education contexts, by avoiding some game design elements settings.},

  abstract = {Gamification has been widely employed in the educational domain over the past eight years when the term became a trend. However, the literature states that gamification still lacks formal definitions to support the design of gamified strategies. This paper aims to create a taxonomy for the game elements, based on gamification experts' opinions. After a brief review from existing work, we extract first the game elements from the current state of the art, and then evaluate them via a survey with 19 gamification and education experts. The resulting taxonomy taxonomy included the description of 21 game elements and their quantitative and qualitative evaluation by the experts. Overall, the proposed taxonomy was in general well accepted by most of the experts. They also suggested expanding it with the inclusion of Narrative and Storytelling game elements. Thus, the main contribution of this paper is proposing a new, confirmed taxonomy to standardise the terminology used to define the game elements as a mean to design and deploy gamification strategies in the educational domain.},

The use of well-known tools such as machine learning and deep learning has piqued the interest of researchers and experts in the field because it has supported research work in discovering great knowledge on the strong and weak points of cryptographic techniques while ushering in the era of automated and AI-driven cryptanalysis.Despite the positive solutions obtained through using DL in the realm of cryptanalysis, it is not without drawbacks. This paper emphasizes the issues encountered when using ML and DL in cryptanalysis as well as new paths of DL with the advent of the quantum neural network approach, which can provide better answers and hence the relevant state of the art.},

  abstract = {A human settlement may exist in an environment which does not allow the use of central resource distribution systems such as national electrical grid, municipal water supply, etc., or where the use of such systems is not preferable by its inhabitants. In such scenarios, there is a need for managing resources that are being produced, stored, and consumed, within the boundaries of such settlements, with a goal to maintain the self-sustainability of such settlement. Settlements are hereafter considered self-sustainable if sufficient resource quantities are available in the observed time period, with regard to defined comfort levels and observed resource type. Considering existing work in the fields of smart cities, self-sustainable settlements, smart grids, Internet of things and existing intelligent agent infrastructures tackling renewable resource management, new agent classes, behaviours and protocols are proposed. A central part of the dissertation work includes developing specialized agent classes and behaviours that would allow to model and simulate the dynamics of a local resource production, storage and consumption in order to pursue and evaluate self- sustainability of the settlement. Such framework could be used by a modeler either to design and simulate a new self-sustainable system, or to evaluate and analyze an existing system, which could lead to considerable improvements in the design of a settlement and its resource production, consumption and storage elements, in regard to the context of self-sustainability.},

The authors present a framework for modeling Large-Scale Multi-Agent Systems (LSMASs) including a graphical modeling language, and a tool, that aim to facilitate development of such systems in a recursive fashion. Smart self-sustainable cities in this chapter are modeled using this language that forms the basis for the Smart Self-Sustainable Human Settlements (SSSHS) framework developed by the authors. The SSSHS framework consists of several sustainability mechanisms which attempt to facilitate the self-sustainability of a human settlement by managing resources such as water, electricity, and heating, based on the current needs, production, and storage using a detailed agent-based methodology. By integrating these two frameworks (LSMAS and SSSHS), the authors show a recursive and layered approach that is able to model large-scale resource management systems in a hierarchical manner by using IoT technologies.},

EGDA proposes four tasks: analysis, design, implementation, and quality assurance that are subdivided in a total of 12 subtasks. One of the benefits of EGDA is that anyone can apply it to develop a game since it keeps development as simple as possible and uses tools for modeling and implementation that do not require a highly technical profile. EGDA has been applied to the creation of seven educational games in healthcare, and has been iteratively refined after each experience. EGDA is evaluated on two aspects. First, the effort and cost needed for creating these games is estimated and compared to current industry standards. Second, impact on knowledge acquisition and a student acceptance are discussed. Results suggest that EGDA can make game development more affordable, which is critical for increased adoption and scalability of game-based learning (GBL), while assuring a high educational value of the resulting games.},

  abstract = {This reissue of the modern classic on the study of argumentation features a new Introduction by the author. A central theme throughout the impressive series of philosophical books and articles Stephen Toulmin has published since 1948 is the way in which assertions and opinions concerning all sorts of topics, brought up in everyday life or in academic research, can be rationally justified. Is there one universal system of norms, by which all sorts of arguments in all sorts of fields must be judged, or must each sort of argument be judged according to its own norms? In The Uses of Argument (1958) Toulmin sets out his views on these questions for the first time. In spite of initial criticisms from logicians and fellow philosophers, The Uses of Argument has been an enduring source of inspiration and discussion to students of argumentation from all kinds of disciplinary background for more than forty years.},

This study uses the context of the German federal election to investigate whether Twitter is used as a forum for political deliberation and whether online messages on Twitter validly mirror offline political sentiment. Using LIWC text analysis software, we conducted a content analysis of over 100,000 messages containing a reference to either a political party or a politician. Our results show that Twitter is indeed used extensively for political deliberation. We find that the mere number of messages mentioning a party reflects the election result. Moreover, joint mentions of two parties are in line with real world political ties and coalitions. An analysis of the tweets' political sentiment demonstrates close correspondence to the parties' and politicians' political positions indicating that the content of Twitter messages plausibly reflects the offline political landscape. We discuss the use of microblogging message content as a valid indicator of political sentiment and derive suggestions for further research.},

  abstract = {Dewey. Bellow. Strauss. Friedman. The University of Chicago has been the home of some of the most important thinkers of the modern age. But perhaps no name has been spoken with more respect than Turabian. The dissertation secretary at Chicago for decades, Kate Turabian literally wrote the book on the successful completion and submission of the student paper. Her Manual for Writers of Research Papers, Theses, and Dissertations, created from her years of experience with research projects across all fields, has sold more than seven million copies since it was first published in 1937. Now, with this seventh edition, Turabian\&8217;s Manual has undergone its most extensive revision, ensuring that it will remain the most valuable handbook for writers at every level\&8212;from first-year undergraduates, to dissertation writers apprehensively submitting final manuscripts, to senior scholars who may be old hands at research and writing but less familiar with new media citation styles. Gregory G. Colomb, Joseph M. Williams, and the late Wayne C. Booth\&8212;the gifted team behind The Craft of Research\&8212;and the University of Chicago Press Editorial Staff combined their wide-ranging expertise to remake this classic resource. They preserve Turabian\&8217;s clear and practical advice while fully embracing the new modes of research, writing, and source citation brought about by the age of the Internet.Booth, Colomb, and Williams significantly expand the scope of previous editions by creating a guide, generous in length and tone, to the art of research and writing. Growing out of the authors\&8217; best-selling Craft of Research, this new section provides students with an overview of every step of the research and writing process, from formulating the right questions to reading critically to building arguments and revising drafts. This leads naturally to the second part of the Manual for Writers, which offers an authoritative overview of citation practices in scholarly writing, as well as detailed information on the two main citation styles (\&8220;notes-bibliography\&8221; and \&8220;author-date\&8221;). This section has been fully revised to reflect the recommendations of the fifteenth edition of The Chicago Manual of Style and to present an expanded array of source types and updated examples, including guidance on citing electronic sources.The final section of the book treats issues of style\&8212;the details that go into making a strong paper. Here writers will find advice on a wide range of topics, including punctuation, table formatting, and use of quotations. The appendix draws together everything writers need to know about formatting research papers, theses, and dissertations and preparing them for submission. This material has been thoroughly vetted by dissertation officials at colleges and universities across the country.This seventh edition of Turabian\&8217;s Manual for Writers of Research Papers, Theses, and Dissertations is a classic reference revised for a new age. It is tailored to a new generation of writers using tools its original author could not have imagined\&8212;while retaining the clarity and authority that generations of scholars have come to associate with the name Turabian.},

In these games, characters are often more than the association of stats and skills popular in online games, and several approaches towards utilizing the character-based information directly to personalize the game playing have been developed, e.g. personality systems. Some of these systems can be integrated into online games, providing a realistic and financially feasible method for improving the ability of these games to personalize the experience to the individual players.

  abstract = {Emergency situations during car driving sometimes force the driver to make a sudden decision. Predicting these decisions will have important applications in updating risk analyses in insurance applications, but also can give insights for drafting autonomous vehicle guidelines. Studying such behavior in experimental settings, however, is limited by ethical issues as it would endanger peoples' lives. Here, we employed the potential of virtual reality (VR) to investigate decision-making in an extreme situation in which participants would have to sacrifice others in order to save themselves. In a VR driving simulation, participants first trained to complete a difficult course with multiple crossroads in which the wrong turn would lead the car to fall down a cliff. In the testing phase, obstacles suddenly appeared on the ``safe'' turn of a crossroad: for the control group, obstacles consisted of trees, whereas for the experimental group, they were pedestrians. In both groups, drivers had to decide between falling down the cliff or colliding with the obstacles. Results showed that differences in personality traits were able to predict this decision: in the experimental group, drivers who collided with the pedestrians had significantly higher psychopathy and impulsivity traits, whereas impulsivity alone was to some degree predictive in the control group. Other factors like heart rate differences, gender, video game expertise, and driving experience were not predictive of the emergency decision in either group. Our results show that self-interest related personality traits affect decision-making when choosing between preservation of self or others in extreme situations and showcase the potential of virtual reality in studying and modeling human decision-making.},

However, their architectures are often overlooked, which hinders their integration and extension. In this paper, we use an approach for architecture recovery to create architectural models for 10 open-source game engines. We use these models to answer the following questions: Which subsystems more often couple with one another? Do game engines share subsystem coupling patterns? We observe that the Low-Level Renderer, Platform Independence Layer and Resource Manager are frequently coupled to the game engine Core. By identifying the most frequent coupling patterns, we describe an emergent game engine architecture and discuss how it can be used by practitioners to improve system understanding and maintainability.},

  abstract = {This paper is intended to serve as a comprehensive introduction to the emerging field concerned with the design and use of ontologies. We observe that disparate backgrounds, languages, tools and techniques are a major barrier to effective communication among people, organisations and/or software understanding (i.e. an ``ontology'') in a given subject area, can improve such communication, which in turn, can give rise to greater reuse and sharing, inter-operability, and more reliable software. After motivating their need, we clarify just what ontologies are and what purpose they serve. We outline a methodology for developing and evaluating ontologies, first discussing informal techniques, concerning such issues as scoping, handling ambiguity, reaching agreement and producing definitions. We then consider the benefits and describe, a more formal approach. We re-visit the scoping phase, and discuss the role of formal languages and techniques in the specification, implementation and evalution of ontologies. Finally, we review the state of the art and practice in this emerging field, considering various case studies, software tools for ontology development, key research issues and future prospects.},

  abstract = {With the rapid growth of the Internet, new communication forms have emerged. This study examines how friendships are developed in a special kind of virtual world: multi-user-dungeons (MUDs). According to the Social Information Processing perspective (Walther, 1992) people learn to verbalize online that which is nonverbal offline, with increasing time. The use of verbal paralanguage should be an important factor in the development of impressions. Sociability, as a general trait, and skepticism towards computer-mediated communication (CMC), as a situation-specific attitude, could also influence this process. One hundred and three MUD users completed a questionnaire concerning their online friendships, MUD use, attitude about MUDding, use of paralanguage, sociability, and skepticism toward CMC. Seventy-seven percent of the MUDders reported relationships with others. Results supported the Social Information Processing perspective: Sociability had little influence, whereas skepticism towards CMC was an important predictor. Only participants who scored low in skepticism use the paralanguage-features provided in MUDs and develop friendships. To examine why the skeptical respondents play MUDs, a cluster analysis was computed. It revealed four types of MUDders, who differ in their attitude toward MUDs. The consequences of different motivations for playing MUDs on the development of friendships are discussed.},

  abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present a holistic approach regarding evaluation of knowledge management (KM) practices on organizational performance. The effects of seven critical success factors (CSFs), namely leadership role, organizational culture, KM strategy, processes and activities, training and education, information technology, and motivation and rewarding system, on organizational performance in the framework of four perspectives of balance scored card (BSC) approach were surveyed. Design/methodology/approach - The research hypotheses were raised based on the four perspectives of this approach, namely, growth and learning, internal processes, customer and financial. By literature review, CSFs of KM and organizational performance along with their items were identified in the framework of BSC's perspectives. Based on these constructs and their items an instrument was designed and distributed among managers and employees of the subsidiary firms of Iran National Petrochemical Company (INPC). Reliability of the instrument was calculated by Chronbach's[alpha] for the two sections of the instrument i.e. KM practices and organizational performance. Also, using factor analysis the construct validity of the questionnaire was approved. Finally, based on the hypotheses of the study and using structural equation modeling the impacts of KM practices on organizational performance were investigated. Findings - The results revealed that KM practices positively and meaningfully (though weak) impact overall organizational performance. This impact is significant only regarding growth and learning dimension and on the other dimensions is insignificant. Also, as customer and financial constructs were loaded on one factor based on the entity of their indicators we considered these two constructs as stakeholders construct. In addition, among the above mentioned seven CSFs, motivation and rewarding system obtained the lowest rank among the survey organizations. Research limitations/implications - The sample is restricted to only three companies, so gathering data from various parts of Iran including both manufacturing and service industries could increase the generalizability of the results obtained. Also, as in this study the data gathered were cross-sectional, a longitudinal study could help gain deeper understanding of the cause-and-effect relationship among the variables. Originality/value - The most significant gap in the literature is the lack of enough application of statistical and comprehensive methods like BSC that KM makes a difference to organizational performance. This study contributes to the field of KM by empirically investigating the impact of KM practices on various measures of organizational performance in order to prove the suitability of a comprehensive approach like BSC.},

This paradox has been explained in terms of a coupling between the macro level that hosts self-organization (and an apparent reduction in entropy), and the micro level (where random processes greatly increase entropy). Metaphorically, the micro level serves as an entropy ``sink,'' permitting overall system entropy to increase while sequestering this increase from the interactions where self- organization is desired. We make this metaphor precise by constructing a simple example of pheromone-based coordination, defining a way to measure the Shannon entropy at the macro (agent) and micro (pheromone) levels, and exhibiting an entropy- based view of the coordination.},

  abstract = {What does it take to become a digitally agile scholar? This manual explains how academics can comfortably navigate the digital world of today and tomorrow. It foregrounds three key domains of digital agility: getting involved in research, education and (community) service, mobilising (digital) skills on various levels, and acting in multiple roles, both individually and interlinked with others.  After an introduction that outlines the foundations of the three-dimensional framework, the chapters focus on different roles and skills associated with evolving as a digital scholar. There is the author, who writes highly specialised texts for expert peers; the storyteller, who crafts accessible narratives to a broader audience in the form of blogs or podcasts; the creator, who uses graphics, audio, and video to motivate audiences to delve deeper into the material; the integrator, who develops and curates multimedia artefacts, disseminating them through channels such as websites, webinars, and open source repositories; and finally the networker, who actively triggers interaction via social media applications and online learning communities. Additionally, the final chapters offer a blueprint for the future digital scholar as a professional learner and as a ``change agent'' who is open to and actively pursues innovation.  Informed by the authors' broad and diverse personal experience, Evolving as a digital scholar offers insight, inspiration, and practical advice. It equips a broad readership with the skills and the mindset to harness new digital developments and navigate the ever-evolving digital age. It will inspire academic teachers and researchers with different backgrounds and levels of knowledge that wish to enhance their digital academic profile.},

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.0 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.},

  abstract = {One of the most influential gaming trends today, Massively Multi Online Role Playing Games (MMORPG), poses new questions about the interaction between the players in the game. Previous work has introduced concepts such as community, commons, and social dilemma to analyze situations where individual choices may result in sub- optimal global results. We propose to use the concept of norms instead. Modelling the players and groups of players in these games as normative systems with the possibility to create norms and sanction norm violations, we can analyze the different kind of norms that may deal with the trade-off between individuals, groups, and society at large. We argue that our model adds complexity where we find earlier concepts lacking some descriptive or overstretching when trying to analyze the balance between individual players and the game playing society.},

  abstract = {Phishing causes billions of dollars in damage every year and poses a serious threat to the Internet economy. Email is still the most commonly used medium to launch phishing attacks~[1]. In this paper, we present a comprehensive natural language based scheme to detect phishing emails using features that are invariant and fundamentally characterize phishing. Our scheme utilizes all the information present in an email, namely, the header, the links and the text in the body. Although it is obvious that a phishing email is designed to elicit an action from the intended victim, none of the existing detection schemes use this fact to identify phishing emails. Our detection protocol is designed specifically to distinguish between ``actionable'' and ``informational'' emails. To this end, we incorporate natural language techniques in phishing detection. We also utilize contextual information, when available, to detect phishing: we study the problem of phishing detection within the contextual confines of the user's email box and demonstrate that context plays an important role in detection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first scheme that utilizes natural language techniques and contextual information to detect phishing. We show that our scheme outperforms existing phishing detection schemes. Finally, our protocol detects phishing at the email level rather than detecting masqueraded websites. This is crucial to prevent the victim from clicking any harmful links in the email. Our implementation called PhishNet-NLP, operates between a user's mail transfer agent (MTA) and mail user agent (MUA) and processes each arriving email for phishing attacks even before reaching the inbox.},

Recent advances have generated a vigorous research effort in understanding the effect of complex connectivity patterns on dynamical phenomena. This book presents a comprehensive account of these effects. A vast number of systems, from the brain to ecosystems, power grids and the Internet, can be represented as large complex networks. This book will interest graduate students and researchers in many disciplines, from physics and statis- tical mechanics, to mathematical biology and information science. Its modular approach allows readers to readily access the sections of most interest to them, and complicated maths is avoided so the text can be easily followed by non-experts in the subject.},

I rather discuss informal norms that emerge through the decentralized interaction of agents within a collective and are not imposed or designed by an authority"[3].

However, gamification is complex and carries a high degree of risk in achieving organizational efficiency. It is therefore advisable to adopt a fragmented approach and selectively gamify individual processes and features, focusing on educational and research activities. When introducing gamification, top management should provide conceptual and regulatory support and HR specialists coordination. Using a distribution model of managerial functions for gaming activities and determining priorities, taking the use of artificial intelligence into account, is shown to be expedient.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces SC2LE (StarCraft II Learning Environment), a reinforce-ment learning environment based on the StarCraft II game. This domain poses a new grand challenge for reinforcement learning, representing a more challenging class of problems than considered in most prior work. It is a multi-agent problem with multiple players interacting; there is imperfect information due to a partially observed map; it has a large action space involving the selection and control of hundreds of units; it has a large state space that must be observed solely from raw input feature planes; and it has delayed credit assignment requiring long-term strategies over thousands of steps. We describe the observation, action, and reward specification for the StarCraft II domain and provide an open source Python-based interface for communicating with the game engine. In addition to the main game maps, we provide a suite of mini-games focusing on different elements of Star-Craft II gameplay. For the main game maps, we also provide an accompanying dataset of game replay data from human expert players. We give initial baseline results for neural networks trained from this data to predict game outcomes and player actions. Finally, we present initial baseline results for canonical deep rein-forcement learning agents applied to the StarCraft II domain. On the mini-games, these agents learn to achieve a level of play that is comparable to a novice player. However, when trained on the main game, these agents are unable to make signifi-cant progress. Thus, SC2LE offers a new and challenging environment for explor-ing deep reinforcement learning algorithms and architectures.},

  abstract = {Many real-world applications require artificial agents to compete and coordinate with other agents in complex environments. As a stepping stone to this goal, the domain of StarCraft has emerged as an important challenge for artificial intelligence research, owing to its iconic and enduring status among the most difficult professional esports and its relevance to the real world in terms of its raw complexity and multi-agent challenges. Over the course of a decade and numerous competitions1--3, the strongest agents have simplified important aspects of the game, utilized superhuman capabilities, or employed hand-crafted sub-systems4. Despite these advantages, no previous agent has come close to matching the overall skill of top StarCraft players. We chose to address the challenge of StarCraft using general-purpose learning methods that are in principle applicable to other complex domains: a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm that uses data from both human and agent games within a diverse league of continually adapting strategies and counter-strategies, each represented by deep neural networks5,6. We evaluated our agent, AlphaStar, in the full game of StarCraft II, through a series of online games against human players. AlphaStar was rated at Grandmaster level for all three StarCraft races and above 99.8\% of officially ranked human players.},

  abstract = {The evolution of mobility sector towards a multimodal and multiservice approach enables new possibilities of interaction for travellers. At once it creates a complex ecosystem where the final users are one of the main key components for the effectiveness and the success of the deployed mobility strategies and solutions. It implies that, both for academic and commercial purposes, a remarkable attention should be put on the design approaches focusing on human aspects in interactive systems. Moreover different methods aiming at enhancing the user experience should be exploited, in order to trigger desirable and worthy innovations. So in this paper we focus on gamification for improving the quality of interaction with the mobility services. In effect, mobility represents a more and more promising domain for the application of playful solutions, although in this field it is nowadays employed mostly for incentivizing smart and sustainable behaviours, also in combination with crowdsourcing. However we can suppose a wider use of this approach in the mobility services, e.g. to improve the overall traveller experience and to increase an active collaboration among the stakeholders. In detail, in this paper we will discuss three main variables to identify which possibilities can emerge in future mobility services by applying a gamification approach: the different stages of a journey, for better knowing the contexts of action and the needs of people potentially interested in; the devices to be exploited, for better accomplishing gamification purposes; the game components, for better understanding how they contribute to fulfill the traveller objectives.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we develop a theory of abstract argumentation systems. An abstract argumentation system is a collection of ``defeasible proofs'', called arguments, that is partially ordered by a relation expressing the difference in conclusive force. The prefix ``abstract'' indicates that the theory is concerned neither with a specification of the underlying language, nor with the development of a subtheory that explains the partial order. An unstructured language, without logical connectives such as negation, makes arguments not (pairwise) inconsistent, but (groupwise) incompatible. Incompatibility and difference in conclusive force cause defeat among arguments. The aim of the theory is to find out which arguments eventually emerge undefeated. These arguments are considered to be in force. Several results are established. The main result is that arguments that are in force are precisely those that are in the limit of a so-called complete argumentation sequence.},

  abstract = {The majority of sensitive and personal data is stored in a number of different Database Management Systems (DBMS). For example, Oracle is frequently used to store corporate data, MySQL serves as the back-end storage for many webstores, and SQLite stores personal data such as SMS messages or browser bookmarks. Consequently, the pervasive use of DBMSes has led to an increase in the rate at which they are exploited in cybercrimes. After a cybercrime occurs, investigators need forensic tools and methods to recreate a timeline of events and determine the extent of the security breach. When a breach involves a compromised system, these tools must make few assumptions about the system (e.g., corrupt storage, poorly configured logging, data tampering). Since DBMSes manage storage independent of the operating system, they require their own set of forensic tools. This dissertation presents 1) our database-agnostic forensic methods to examine DBMS contents from any evidence source (e.g., disk images or RAM snapshots) without using a live system and 2) applications of our forensic analysis methods to secure data. The foundation of this analysis is page carving, our novel database forensic method that we implemented as the tool DBCarver. We demonstrate that DBCarver is capable of reconstructing DBMS contents, including metadata and deleted data, from various types of digital evidence. Since DBMS storage is managed independently of the operating system, DBCarver can be used for new methods to securely delete data (i.e., data sanitization). In the event of suspected log tampering or direct modification to DBMS storage, DBCarver can be used to verify log integrity and discover storage inconsistencies.},

New tools for analyzing these kinds of evidence are introduced, like argument diagramming, abductive reasoning, an analysis of conditional relevance and a new dialectical model of explanation.},

In this paper, we develop a generalizable chatbot architecture (CASS) to provide social support for community members in an online health community. The CASS architecture is based on advanced neural network algorithms, thus it can handle new inputs from users and generate a variety of responses to them. CASS is also generalizable as it can be easily migrate to other online communities. With a follow-up field experiment, CASS is proven useful in supporting individual members who seek emotional support. Our work also contributes to fill the research gap on how a chatbot may influence the whole community's engagement.},

The efficiency of the enterprise is hence seriously affected by these factors. The concept of the digital twin provides new research directions for scheduling systems. In order to improve the overall performance of the production scheduling system in a frame shop, virtual-real fusion technology utilizing the digital twin is first introduced to integrate the information and logistics flows in the scheduling process as part of the manufacturing execution system-based production scheduling mechanism. The balance optimization of the mixed-flow production line is then carried out, and the mixed-flow production line balance and sequencing models are established. A scheduling system for the frame shop combining various system functions is finally designed based on the sequencing model and production status. The scheduling system comprehensively considers the two uncertain factors of materials and orders to generate scheduling information through an intelligent scheduling mode while realizing real-time synergy between the information and logistics flows. The system has achieved excellent implementation results in the frame shop and provides a reference for the application of digital twins in production workshops.},

The proposed bidirectional phase compensation can enlarge the central angle of the curved hologram twice as that of the traditional method which is one-directional phase compensation. Due to the positive relationship between the angle of a curved hologram and its view angle, our proposed method is expected to double the view angle compared with the traditional method. Both numerical simulation and optical experiment results verify the validity and feasibility of the proposed method.},

  abstract = {The Belief Desire Intention (BDI) agent paradigm provides a powerful basis for developing complex systems based on autonomous intelligent agents. These agents have, at any point in time, a set of intentions encoding the various tasks the agent is working on. Despite its importance, the problem of selecting which intention to progress at any point in time has received almost no attention and has been mostly left to the programmer to resolve in an application-dependent manner. In this paper, we implement and evaluate two domainindependent intention selection mechanisms based on the ideas of enablement checking and low coverage prioritisation. Through a battery of automatically generated synthetic tests and one real program, we compare these with the commonly used intention selection mechanisms of First-In-First-Out (FIFO) and Round Robin (RR). We found that enablement checking, which is incorporated into low coverage prioritisation, is never detrimental and provides substantial benefits when running vulnerable programs in dynamic environments. This is a significant finding as such a check can be readily applied to FIFO and RR, giving an extremely simple and effective mechanism to be added to existing BDI frameworks. In turn, low coverage prioritisation provides a significant further benefit.},

  abstract = {"The field of cybersecurity and cybercrime is a critical and rapidly evolving area of study. As our society becomes more and more reliant on technology, the risks of cybercrime increase. This book provides a comprehensive introduction to the field, covering both cybercrime and cybersecurity. The book starts by providing an overview of common threats and the risk management view of cybercrime. It explores the different types of threats, such as hacking, malware, phishing, and social engineering, and the various ways in which they can impact individuals, businesses, and society at large. It also introduces the concept of risk management and the different approaches that can be used to manage cyber risks, such as risk avoidance, mitigation, transfer, and acceptance. From there, the book delves into the three key areas of cybersecurity: people, process, and technology. It explores the role of people in cybersecurity, including staffing, psychological profiling, role sensitivity, awareness, training, and education. It also examines the importance of process, including strategy and governance, policy, configuration management, and physical security. Finally, the book explores the critical role of technology, including system security, identification and authentication, authorization and access control, and cryptography. The book is designed to be accessible to a wide range of readers, from first-year students studying cybercrime and cybersecurity for the first time to seasoned professionals who need to better understand the purpose of cybersecurity programs and controls. It is written in a clear and concise manner, with each chapter building on the previous one to provide a comprehensive overview of the field. Overall, this book is an essential resource for anyone interested in the field of cybersecurity and cybercrime. It provides a critical introduction to the key concepts, theories, and practices in the field, and is sure to be a valuable reference for years to come"--},

  abstract = {Today's distributed applications such as sensor networks, mobile multimedia, and intelligent transportation systems pose huge engineering. Such systems often comprise different components that with each other as peers, as such forming a decentralized. The system components and collaborations change over time, in unanticipated ways. Multiagent systems belong to a class decentralized systems that are known for realizing qualities such adaptability, robustness, and scalability in such environments. typical way to structure and manage interactions among agents is means of organizations. Existing approaches usually endow agents a dual responsibility: on the one hand agents have to play roles the associated functionality in the organization, on the hand agents are responsible for setting up organizations and organization dynamics. Engineering realistic multiagent in which agents encapsulate this dual responsibility is a task. this article, we present an organization model for context-driven agent organizations. The model defines abstractions that application developers to describe dynamic organizations. organization model is part of an integrated approach, called: Middleware Architecture for COntext-driven Dynamic agent. The complementary part of the MACODO approach is a platform that supports the distributed execution of dynamic specified using the abstractions, as described in Weyns al. [2009]. the model, the life-cycle management of dynamic organizations is from the agents: organizations are first-class citizens, their dynamics are governed by laws. The laws specify how changes the system (e.g., an agent joins an organization) and changes the context (e.g., information observed in the environment) lead dynamic reorganizations. As such, the model makes it easier to and specify dynamic organizations in multiagent systems, promotes reusing the life-cycle management of dynamic organizations. organization model is formally described to specify the semantics the abstractions, and ensure its type safety. We apply the organization to specify dynamic organizations for a traffic monitoring application.},

A chatbot is a type of software that can automate conversations and interact with people through messaging platforms.  Designed to convincingly simulate the way a human would behave as a conversational partner, chatbot systems typically require continuous tuning and testing, and many in production remain unable to adequately converse or pass the industry standard Turing test. The term "ChatterBot" was originally coined by Michael Mauldin (creator of the first Verbot) in 1994 to describe these conversational programs.Chatbots are used in dialog systems for various purposes including customer service, request routing, or information gathering. While some chatbot applications use extensive word-classification processes, natural language processors, and sophisticated AI, others simply scan for general keywords and generate responses using common phrases obtained from an associated library or database. Most chatbots are accessed on-line via website popups or through virtual assistants. They can be classified into usage categories that include: commerce (e-commerce via chat), education, entertainment, finance, health, news, and productivity.},

Usually such patterns are used by string-searching algorithms for "find" or "find and replace" operations on strings, or for input validation. It is a technique developed in theoretical computer science and formal language theory. The concept arose in the 1950s when the American mathematician Stephen Cole Kleene formalized the description of a regular language. The concept came into common use with Unix text-processing utilities. Different syntaxes for writing regular expressions have existed since the 1980s, one being the POSIX standard and another, widely used, being the Perl syntax. Regular expressions are used in search engines, search and replace dialogs of word processors and text editors, in text processing utilities such as sed and AWK and in lexical analysis. Many programming languages provide regex capabilities either built-in or via libraries.},

  abstract = {The Atari 2600 is a home video game console developed and produced by Atari, Inc. Released in September 1977 as the Atari Video Computer System (Atari VCS), it popularized microprocessor-based hardware and games stored on swappable ROM cartridges, a format first used with the Fairchild Channel F in 1976. The VCS was bundled with two joystick controllers, a conjoined pair of paddle controllers, and a game cartridge---initially Combat and later Pac-Man. Sears sold the system as the Tele-Games Video Arcade. Atari rebranded the VCS as the Atari 2600 in November 1982, alongside the release of the Atari 5200. Atari was successful at creating arcade video games, but their development cost and limited lifespan drove CEO Nolan Bushnell to seek a programmable home system. The first inexpensive microprocessors from MOS Technology in late 1975 made this feasible. The console was prototyped under the codename Stella by Atari subsidiary Cyan Engineering. Lacking funding to complete the project, Bushnell sold Atari to Warner Communications in 1976. The Atari VCS launched in 1977 with nine games on 2 KB cartridges. Atari ported many of their arcade games to the system, and the VCS versions of Breakout and Night Driver are in color while the arcade originals have monochrome graphics. The system's first killer application was the home conversion of Taito's arcade game Space Invaders in 1980. Adventure, also released in 1980, was one of the first action-adventure video games and contains the first widely recognized Easter egg. The popularity of the VCS led to the founding of Activision and other third-party game developers and competition from the Intellivision and, later, ColecoVision consoles. Games grew to use four or more times the storage size of the launch games with significantly more advanced visuals and gameplay than the system was designed for, such as Activision's Pitfall!. By 1982, the Atari 2600 was the dominant game system in North America. Poor decisions by Atari management damaged both the system and company's reputation, most notably the release of two highly anticipated games for the 2600: a port of the arcade game Pac-Man and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. Pac-Man became the 2600's highest-selling game, but was panned for being inferior to the arcade version. E.T. was rushed to market for the holiday shopping season and was similarly disparaged. Both games, and a glut of third-party shovelware, were factors in ending Atari's relevance in the console market, contributing to the video game crash of 1983. Warner sold the assets of Atari's consumer electronics division to former Commodore CEO Jack Tramiel in 1984; in 1986 the new Atari Corporation under Tramiel released a revised, low-cost 2600 model, and the backward-compatible Atari 7800, but it was Nintendo that led the recovery of the industry with its 1985 launch of the Nintendo Entertainment System. Production of the Atari 2600 ended in 1992, with an estimated 30 million units sold across its lifetime.},

  abstract = {The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt‍ is a 2015 action role-playing game developed and published by the Polish studio CD Projekt. It is the sequel to the 2011 game The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings and the third game in The Witcher video game series, played in an open world with a third-person perspective. The games follow the Witcher series of fantasy novels written by Andrzej Sapkowski. The game takes place in a fictional fantasy world based on Slavic mythology. Players control Geralt of Rivia, a monster slayer for hire known as a Witcher, and search for his adopted daughter, who is on the run from the otherworldly Wild Hunt. Players battle the game's many dangers with weapons and magic, interact with non-player characters, and complete quests to acquire experience points and gold, which are used to increase Geralt's abilities and purchase equipment. The game's story has three possible endings, determined by the player's choices at key points in the narrative. Development began in 2011 and lasted for three and a half years. Central and Northern European cultures formed the basis of the game's world. The game was developed using the REDengine 3, which enabled CD Projekt to create a complex story without compromising its open world. The music was primarily composed by Marcin Przyby\l owicz and performed by the Brandenburg State Orchestra. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt was released for PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One in May 2015, with a Nintendo Switch version released in October 2019, and PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions (subtitled "Complete Edition") released in December 2022. The game received critical acclaim, with praise for its gameplay, narrative, world design, combat, and visuals, although it received minor criticism due to technical issues. It holds more than 200 game of the year awards and has been cited as one of the greatest video games ever made. Two expansions were also released to critical acclaim: Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine. A Game of the Year edition was released in August 2016, with the base game, expansions and all downloadable content included. The game has sold over 50 million units as of March 2023, making it one of the best-selling video games of all time.},

  abstract = {One reason why many organizations are still struggling with knowledge management (KM) and failing in their endeavours to realize its full potential is that they lack the support of a strong theoretical foundation to guide them in its implementation. A sound KM implementation framework helps to fulfil this need by providing important guiding principles and directions. However, developing such a framework can be a challenging task for managers and practitioners as they may lack the knowledge of what characteristics, elements and constructs should be included in it. Implementation frameworks that do not have the necessary elements in place can paint an incomplete picture of KM and its implementation process, thus providing a suboptimal guidance for conducting KM. This paper reviews the existing KM implementation frameworks presented in the literature in order to determine and propose a set of guidelines for constructing them. By utilizing these guidelines to develop a KM implementation framework, it is hoped that a stronger theoretical foundation can be constructed, thus facilitating the accomplishment of KM.

  abstract = {The concept of an agent has become important in both Artificial Intelligence (AI) and mainstream computer science. Our aim in this paper is to point the reader at what we perceive to be the most important theoretical and practical issues associated with the design and construction of intelligent agents. For convenience, we divide these issues into three areas (though as the reader will see, the divisions are at times somewhat arbitrary). Agent theory is concerned with the question of what an agent is, and the use of mathematical formalisms for representing and reasoning about the properties of agents. Agent architectures can be thought of as software engineering models of agents; researchers in this area are primarily concerned with the problem of designing software or hardware systems that will satisfy the properties specified by agent theorists. Finally, agent languages are software systems for programming and experimenting with agents; these languages may embody principles proposed by theorists. The paper is not intended to serve as a tutorial introduction to all the issues mentioned; we hope instead simply to identify the most important issues, and point to work that elaborates on them. The article includes a short review of current and potential applications of agent technology.},

  abstract = {Federated Learning (FL, or Collaborative Learning (CL)) has surely gained a reputation for not only building Machine Learning (ML) models that rely on distributed datasets, but also for starting to play a key role in security and privacy solutions to protect sensitive data and information from a variety of ML-related attacks. This made it an ideal choice for emerging networks such as Internet of Things (IoT) systems, especially with its state-of-the-art algorithms that focus on their practical use over IoT networks, despite the presence of resource-constrained devices. However, the heterogeneous nature of the current devices and models in complex IoT networks has seriously hindered the FL training process's ability to perform well. Thus, rendering it almost unsuitable for direct deployment over IoT networks despite ongoing efforts to tackle this issue and overcome this challenging obstacle. As a result, the main characteristics of FL in the IoT from both security and privacy aspects are presented in this study. We broaden our research to investigate and analyze cutting-edge FL algorithms, models, and protocols, with a focus on their efficacy and practical application across IoT networks and systems alike. This is followed by a comparative analysis of the recently available protection solutions for FL that can be based on cryptographic and non-cryptographic solutions over heterogeneous, dynamic IoT networks. Moreover, the proposed work provides a list of suggestions and recommendations that can be applied to enhance the effectiveness of the adoption of FL and to achieve higher robustness against attacks, especially in heterogeneous dynamic IoT networks and in the presence of resource-constrained devices.},

  abstract = {An algorithm to predict breast cancer risk, Mirai, outperforms clinical risk models across test cohorts from the United States, Sweden, and Taiwan.           ,              Don't risk it                            Mammograms are a common but imperfect way of assessing breast cancer risk. Current U.S. breast cancer screening guidelines all use a component of cancer risk assessment to inform clinical course. Yala               et al.               developed a machine learning model called ``Mirai'' to predict breast cancer risk based on traditional mammograms. The authors' risk model performed better than Tyrer-Cuzick and previous deep learning models at identifying both 5-year breast cancer risk and high-risk patients across multiple international cohorts. Mirai also performed similarly across race and ethnicity categories, suggesting the potential for improvement in patient care across the board.                        ,                             Improved breast cancer risk models enable targeted screening strategies that achieve earlier detection and less screening harm than existing guidelines. To bring deep learning risk models to clinical practice, we need to further refine their accuracy, validate them across diverse populations, and demonstrate their potential to improve clinical workflows. We developed Mirai, a mammography-based deep learning model designed to predict risk at multiple timepoints, leverage potentially missing risk factor information, and produce predictions that are consistent across mammography machines. Mirai was trained on a large dataset from Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) in the United States and tested on held-out test sets from MGH, Karolinska University Hospital in Sweden, and Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (CGMH) in Taiwan, obtaining C-indices of 0.76 (95\% confidence interval, 0.74 to 0.80), 0.81 (0.79 to 0.82), and 0.79 (0.79 to 0.83), respectively. Mirai obtained significantly higher 5-year ROC AUCs than the Tyrer-Cuzick model (                                P                              {$<$} 0.001) and prior deep learning models Hybrid DL (                                P                              {$<$} 0.001) and Image-Only DL (                                P                              {$<$} 0.001), trained on the same dataset. Mirai more accurately identified high-risk patients than prior methods across all datasets. On the MGH test set, 41.5\% (34.4 to 48.5) of patients who would develop cancer within 5 years were identified as high risk, compared with 36.1\% (29.1 to 42.9) by Hybrid DL (                                P                              = 0.02) and 22.9\% (15.9 to 29.6) by the Tyrer-Cuzick model (                                P                              {$<$} 0.001).},

This research attempts to analyze the concept of gamification and its components, types of players, and conditions for successful design by reviewing the literature. In addition, the research aims to investigate how the gamification design process can be used in education and what empirical effects are expected. The research also aims to propose a conceptual framework for gamification integration in eLearning systems based on the instructional design (ID) model. The methodology used in the identification of successful strategies and experiences is based on reviewing the literature that explains gamification, game strategies, and previous gamification frameworks. Examples and suggestions of gamification are included. The findings illustrate the potential techniques for applying gamification in eLearning systems, especially e-courses. The differences between Digital Games, gamebased learning, and gamification are discussed. The findings propose a conceptual framework for gamification integration in eLearning systems based on the ID Model. Gamification has been incorporated into the general phases of the ID model, namely, analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation. The findings help decision-makers and stakeholders at higher education institutions differentiate between games, game-based learning, and gamification integration into education and determine suitable ID models as conceptual frameworks for systematically delivering learning content through gamification.},

  abstract = {Abstract           Attending classes and sleeping well are important for students' academic success. However, early classes might impede learning by contributing to absenteeism and insufficient sleep. We used big datasets collected passively from university students to test the hypothesis that morning classes are associated with poorer attendance, shorter sleep, and lower grades. Wi-Fi connection data were used to estimate attendance rates of 24,678 students enrolled in lecture courses with start times ranging from 08:00 to 16:00. Students' interactions with the university's Learning Management System (LMS) were used to estimate nocturnal sleep opportunities by compiling 17.4 million logins from 39,458 students with data sorted by students' first class of the day. Objective sleep behavior was assessed in 181 students who took part in a 6-week actigraphy study. We found that Wi-Fi confirmed attendance was about 15 percentage points lower in students taking classes at 08:00 compared with later start times. Actigraphy data revealed that students frequently slept past the start of morning classes. LMS and actigraphy data showed that nocturnal sleep opportunities and total sleep time decreased with earlier class start times due to students waking up earlier. Analyses of grades in 27,281 students showed that having morning classes on more days of the week resulted in a lower grade point average. These findings suggest cumulative negative effects of morning classes on learning. Early morning classes force many students to decide to either sleep more and skip class, or sleep less to attend class. Therefore, universities should avoid scheduling early morning classes.                        Significance Statement             We show that morning classes are associated with lower attendance, shorter nocturnal sleep, and lower grade point average in university students. Scalable methods for measuring attendance and sleep were developed using students' Wi-Fi connection data and interactions with the Learning Management System. Students had lower attendance rates and frequently slept past the start of early morning classes. However, students still lost about an hour of sleep on average when they had early morning classes due to waking up earlier than usual. Students who had morning classes on more days of the week had a lower grade point average. Our results suggest cumulative negative effects of morning classes on students' academic performance. Universities should avoid scheduling early morning classes.},

Our algorithm is decentralized and it only requires local information about other agents. In addition, the complexity of the proposed algorithm is analyzed to show that it is easy to be implemented. We then conduct a variety of experiments in four different networks to verify the performance of the proposed algorithm, the results demonstrate that compared with the greedy mechanism, our algorithm can highly improve the system profit.},

This was largely evidenced through the significant role played by social media platforms in the recent uprisings in the Arab world. In this paper, we take up a study of social media engagement patterns of users from the developing world through a study of Twitter's role during the recent Tunisian uprising. Motivated by the results of a user survey conducted mainly for users from the developing world who tweeted heavily during the uprisings in the Arab world, we propose a novel method for subjectivity analysis of tweets corresponding to political events in the developing world. Our proposed method differs from previous subjectivity analysis approaches in that it is the first method that takes into account social features of social media platforms for the subjectivity classification task. Through experimental evaluations, we observe the accuracy of the proposed method to be 83.3\&\#x025; which demonstrates a promising outcome for large-scale application of our proposed subjectivity analysis technique.},

This paper aims to propose a novel management theory, Intellectual Management (IlM), which is an integration of knowledge management (KM) and character management (CM).

Taking the results and findings of case study into consideration, the authors built a theoretical model of IlM. As a conceptual framework, the IlM model is proposed and analyzed in terms of definition, function, process, tool, and feature. It was found that (1) IlM is rich in meaning that is constituted of five management levels including component, structure, mode, method, and target; (2) IlM would be embedded into the existing management functions such as strategizing, organizing, decision-making, motivating and controlling, and management subprocesses including research and development (R\&D), logistics, production, marketing and service; (3) an organization which properly engages in IlM would show some features, which could be introduced as evaluation criteria of IlM maturity; (4) the IlM could apply the prior management tools regarding to KM and CM or explore some new specific tool packages; and (5) currently, the organizational destiny is depended on the effective IlM which integrates and balances the roles of KM and CM. IlM is expected to be an effective management idea for knowledge-intensive organizations in future competitive environments. \copyright{} 2015, The Author(s).},

  abstract = {The Covid-19 outbreak affected the operations of various businesses due to the temporary closure of several industries. Virtual Reality (VR) technology has experienced a surge in demand. As a new form of human-computer interaction, VR introduces new opportunities for game development. In 2020, the global market for VR games was estimated at \$15.81 billion and expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 18.0\% from 2021 to 2028. Compared with traditional computer games, the immersive nature of VR games and the use of VR headsets bring new experiences to players. A few studies of players' feedbacks and concerns for VR were carried out to enable game developers to better take of the growing VR market. Nevertheless, research conducted on the influence of VR on player reviews data uploaded in the community was limited. Thus, this paper analyzes the impact of VR on the player community by carrying out an analysis of the Half-Life series. The Half-Life series contains three generations: Half-Life (1998), Half-Life 2 (2004), and Half-Life Alyx (2020), which are available on Steam. Steam is a video game digital distribution platform maintained by Valve Corporation. In this study, we first collected the dataset of Half-Life series reviews available on Steam. Notably, we collected a new review dataset of the Half-Life series from Steam, including approximately 60,000 Half-Life 2 with its two downloaded contents (non-VR edition) reviews and 40,000 Half-Life: Alyx (VR edition) reviews up to June 2021. Next, we used the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model, and three experts were involved in analyzing these topics to categorize reviews with 11 topics of Half-Life: Alyx. We also detected the pivotal insight that most game players are concerned with only five topics of fundamental game elements between two games. Furthermore, players' positive ratings were compared on these five topics between two games via hypothesis testing to explore the impact of VR technology on video games. Significantly, the p-value of our two-sample t-test reveals the fact that VR has no significant impact on these fundamental game elements.},

The population of the study consisted of 800 big and medium manufacturing companies listed in Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers (2012). Findings The results of this paper support a positive and significant impact of TQM practice on knowledge management processes. Furthermore, the relationship between knowledge management and innovation performance has been a proved. However, further analysis on dimension level indicates that knowledge acquisition failed to show significant relationship with innovation performance. Originality/value This study addresses one of the recent issues within the Malaysian context of becoming a developed nation, which is innovation performance, specifically for manufacturing companies. To do so, the overlapping relationships among TQM practices, knowledge management, and innovation performance have been tested.},

The success of these games is based on the ability to create a sense of immersion for the gamers. In the case presented here, dedicated gamers were also preferred when hiring personnel to develop the games. Speaking about the know-how of this specific group in terms of phronesis, the detailed and practical understanding of a particular field, enables an understanding of the idiosyncratic competence of this group and its importance for the development process. The video game development process is also structured to enable an open-ended process under the continuous influence of the gamers. The article concludes that innovative and creative work needs to be able to exploit a variety of competencies and that the notion of phronesis has to date been relatively under-theorized and therefore deserves more detailed attention.},

In this study, we used the Game Ontology Project (GOP), a wiki-enabled hierarchy of elements of gameplay used by games studies researchers, in a game design class. Students found it useful for learning. However, encouraging sustained participation was challenging because students tended to view the GOP as a static source, rather than a participatory and editable resource. Expert analysis of the student's contributions to the ontology found them to be useful and significant.

In this paper, a novel hybrid method has been proposed to improve response time for ambulance dispatching. The proposed approach uses a linear hybrid metric based on network centrality measures, nearest neighbor method and first-in first-out (FIFO) policy. Other important parameters in ambulance dispatching such as the operating environment, rate of incoming emergency calls, available resources, hospitalization probability of the patients as well as distances and locations of units are all part of information used in this proposed approach. In line with the traditional metrics used in previous works, we have adopted a linear combined metric which is adjusted according to environment parameters. Results of extensive simulation experiments show reductions in response time by as much as 42\% as compared to previous methods.},

Whilst it has been around for about 30\,years, it is still unclear for educators how to make pedagogical advantage of it on a broader scale, and how it can actually impact meaningfully on teaching and learning in higher education. This paper seeks to provide an overview of research on AI applications in higher education through a systematic review. Out of 2656 initially identified publications for the period between 2007 and 2018, 146 articles were included for final synthesis, according to explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria. The descriptive results show that most of the disciplines involved in AIEd papers come from Computer Science and STEM, and that quantitative methods were the most frequently used in empirical studies. The synthesis of results presents four areas of AIEd applications in academic support services, and institutional and administrative services: 1. profiling and prediction, 2. assessment and evaluation, 3. adaptive systems and personalisation, and 4. intelligent tutoring systems. The conclusions reflect on the almost lack of critical reflection of challenges and risks of AIEd, the weak connection to theoretical pedagogical perspectives, and the need for further exploration of ethical and educational approaches in the application of AIEd in higher education.},

The results showed that gamification is used for various educational purposes, at many learning levels in various environments, and in a wide variety of learning fields.

  abstract = {Social gamification, which allows technology users to interact with each other in gamified tasks, has drawn increasing interest due to its effectiveness in facilitating users' game engagement and task efforts. In social gamification, users can compete or cooperate with other users or teams to complete game tasks and achieve game goals. However, it remains unclear how various social interaction mechanisms (SIMs), such as cooperation, interpersonal competition, and intergroup competition, influence gamification outcomes when they are separately or jointly implemented. In addition, the effects of SIMs on experiential and instrumental gamification outcomes have not been well differentiated. In this study, we systematically investigate the influences of these fundamental SIMs, as well as the possible interaction effects among them, on fitness app users' game engagement and fitness behavior. Using a fitness app custom-developed for the Chinese market, Fitness Castle, we conducted a longitudinal field experiment to test our proposed model and hypotheses. The results indicate that when separately implemented, cooperation and interpersonal competition can lead to differential instrumental gamification outcomes in the fitness context. We also systematically compare the differential gamification outcomes when cooperation, interpersonal competition, and intergroup competition are combined in various coopetition settings. Our study offers a theory-based framework and design principles for social gamification. Our findings help practitioners better design SIMs in their gamified technologies with the purpose of achieving optimal experiential and instrumental gamification outcomes simultaneously.},

  abstract = {With the increasing complexity of network attacks, an active defense based on intelligence sharing becomes crucial. There is an important issue in intelligence analysis that automatically extracts threat actions from cyber threat intelligence (CTI) reports. To address this problem, we propose EX-Action, a framework for extracting threat actions from CTI reports. EX-Action finds threat actions by employing the natural language processing (NLP) technology and identifies actions by a multimodal learning algorithm. At the same time, a metric is used to evaluate the information completeness of the extracted action obtained by EX-Action. By the experiment on the CTI reports that consisted of sentences with complex structure, the experimental result indicates that EX-Action can achieve better performance than two state-of-the-art action extraction methods in terms of accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score.},

However, information overload and the uncertainty of topic hotness evaluation have been obstacles for hot topic detection. The paper proposes a method of detecting hot topics in professional blogs. The proposed method is based on the characteristics of the professional blogs and mainly analyzes candidate topics that are likely to be hot. First, a word network based on high frequency keywords and co-occurrences of the keywords is constructed, and then the candidate topics are extracted by analyzing the structure of the word network. The opinion networks with respect to the topics in different time intervals are subsequently constructed for opinion analysis. Finally, hot topics are identified by computing the user participation degree, opinion communication degree, and timeliness of the candidate topics. Experimental results show the proposed method is feasible and reasonable. \copyright{} 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

Although this process is often taken as a cognitive process, research has shown a strong connection between emotion and cognition. Recent research has suggested that positive emotions can influence the way cognitive material is organized and processed. This study examined the relationship between students' emotional states prior to task engagement to their problem-solving patterns. Results revealed that students with positive emotions, compared to the negative and mixed emotion groups, were characterized as regulatory problem-solvers who were more engaged in self-regulatory activities. Students with negative emotions were characterized by less variety of search activities as well as little or no regulatory activities.},

  abstract = {Database and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can benefit from each other. On one hand, AI can make database more intelligent (AI4DB). For example, traditional empirical database optimization techniques (e.g., cost estimation, join order selection, knob tuning, index and view selection) cannot meet the high-performance requirement for large-scale database instances, various applications and diversified users, especially on the cloud. Fortunately, learning-based techniques can alleviate this problem. On the other hand, database techniques can optimize AI models (DB4AI). For example, AI is hard to deploy in real applications, because it requires developers to write complex codes and train complicated models. Database techniques can be used to reduce the complexity of using AI models, accelerate AI algorithms and provide AI capability inside databases. Thus both DB4AI and AI4DB have been extensively studied recently. In this paper, we review existing studies on AI4DB and DB4AI. For AI4DB, we review the techniques on learning-based configuration tuning, optimizer, index/view advisor, and security. For DB4AI, we review AI-oriented declarative language, AI-oriented data governance, training acceleration, and inference acceleration. Finally, we provide research challenges and future directions.},
